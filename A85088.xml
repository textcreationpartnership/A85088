            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE Moſt Reverend FATHER in GOD, WILLIAM By DIVINE PROVIDENCE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, HIS GRACE, Primate of all ENGLAND and Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan; and one of the Lords of His Majeſtie's Moſt Honourable Privy Council,</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>May it pleaſe Your GRACE,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Humbly preſent to your Grace's Patronage, ſome <hi>Remains</hi> of an excellent Perſon, for whom Your Grace was pleaſed to expreſs a great value while he lived, and whom You are ſtill pleaſed, upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to mention with great kindneſs. Had he lived to have publiſhed any of theſe Diſcourſes himſelf, he would have choſen no other Patron; and had he lived a little long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he would have found, that he had needed no other. For ſince ſome may wonder, that ſo great a Man ſhould go off
<pb facs="tcp:170758:5"/>the Stage with no greater Character, than one of the Town-Preachers at <hi>Lyn Regis;</hi> it is fit the World ſhould know, that Your Grace, who is the peculiar Patron of modeſt and neglected Worth, deſigned better things for him.</p>
                  <p>That great honour I have for Dr. <hi>Falkner</hi>'s Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, to whoſe wiſe inſtructions I owe that little Knowledge I have attained to, would eaſily have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me to have given the World a more particular account of his Life, which was adorned with as many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Vertues, as I believe this laſt Age can ſhew in any one man. But though diſtance of place could not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt our Correſpondence nor our Friendſhip, yet it has for many years deprived me of the familiarities and intimacies of his converſation, which give the trueſt Character of any man; and I dare not undertake a work, wherein I can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerve my Friend, nor ſatisfie the World.</p>
                  <p>As for theſe poſthumous Treatiſes, he deſigned only the firſt of them for the Preſs, which concerns <hi>Reproaching</hi> and <hi>Cenſures;</hi> which he obſerved, was grown ſo common a fault, that it is generally thought to be none: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the firſt Part, he ſhews the great Evil and Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, and how irreconcileable it is with a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Spirit. But then he conſidered, that as men, who are moſt guilty of this vice, have no ſenſe of it themſelves; ſo they are very apt to charge thoſe with it, who are not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whoever has had the courage and honeſty to reprove the Schiſms and Factions, that are among us, and to cenſure the errors and miſcarriages of the ſeveral Sects and Parties of Chriſtians, have been branded with the ignominious name of <hi>Railers,</hi> and <hi>Revilers,</hi> and <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
<pb facs="tcp:170758:5"/>of the Brethren;</hi> and therefore in his Second Part, he ſhews, that ſuch juſt and ſober Cenſures as theſe, which are deſigned to convince men of their errors and miſtakes, are ſo far from being a fault, that they are a neceſſary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And becauſe ſome men are tranſported with ſuch an intemperate zeal, that they do not impartially conſider, what is truly blame-worthy in thoſe, who differ from them, but cenſure and condemn, at all adventures, whatever is ſaid or done by men of ſuch a Party or Character; He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to himſelf, particularly to conſider the ſeveral Sects and Profeſſions of Chriſtians, and what it is, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves reproof and Cenſure in them: which he has done with great Candour and Judgement, but did not live to perfect it. For we have no reaſon to doubt, but the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> ſhould have had their ſhare too, as well as the other Sects amongſt us, but either that Part was not done, or it was loſt, for no Remains could be found of it.</p>
                  <p>As for his Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi>'s <hi>Sure-Footing,</hi> that was written many years ſince, and deſigned by him for the Preſs; but by that time he had finiſhed it, he found that work done to his hand by a very excellent Pen, which put an end to that Controverſie, and therefore he laid it by without any intention to make it publick. But ſince his Death, ſome of his Friends have had other thoughts of it, and indeed, it is ſo uſeful a Diſcourſe, that though there is no need of a new Anſwer to <hi>Serjeant,</hi> ſince the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> yet I believe it will not be unacceptable to Learned men.</p>
                  <p>He penn'd very few Sermons in long hand, which, I ſuppoſe, is the reaſon, why there are no more publiſhed.
<pb facs="tcp:170758:6"/>Theſe that are, beſides the uſefulneſs of the ſeveral Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, may ſerve as a ſpecimen of his plain and pious way of inſtructing the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lord,</hi> I ſhould be very ungrateful, ſhould I neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this opportunity to make my publick acknowledgements to Your Grace for thoſe extraordinary favours I have ſo lately received from You; on which the eaſe and comfort of my life does ſo much depend, that I am for ever bound to implore the Divine Majeſty to bleſs Your Grace with all happineſs and proſperity in this life, and with the rewards of an exemplary Piety and Vertue in the next, which is the hearty Prayer of,</p>

But where the heart is good and upright, there true integrity prevails; and though an evil man may in many outward things, ſpeak and do as the good man doth, out of <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> and ſtill continue wicked; no good man can ſpeak and do evil things, according to the practice of the ſinful and vicious perſon; and whoſoever doth ſo, muſt be <hi>really wicked;</hi> becauſe goodneſs and uprightneſs, both hate all counterfeiting and <hi>diſſembling,</hi> and all other compliances with ſin and evil.</p>

He declares from the writings of the Old Teſtament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15. <hi>Their throat is an open Sepulchre, with their tongues they have uſed deceit, the poyſon of aſps is under their lips.

And what S. <hi>Paul</hi> adds, that their <hi>feet are ſwift to ſhed blood,</hi> even this is frequently the natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the ſame ſin. For when men by <hi>evil ſpeaking,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of their Superiours, have wrought themſelves and others, into a greater diſlike of them, and hatred towards them, how oft this hath fomented <hi>fierce paſſions,</hi> and wrought diſpoſitions to cruelty, and put men upon inſurrections and forwardneſs of <hi>ſhedding blood;</hi> the Hiſtories of all times, and the remembrance of this laſt Age in our own Nation,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170758:13"/>will give undeniable evidence.

HAving ſhewed the <hi>unreaſonable proceedings</hi> of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling tongue, and how unruly an evil it is, I ſhall now add ſome further general conſiderations, concerning the <hi>greatneſs of the ſin</hi> of reproaching others, eſpecially our Superiours.

Wherefore,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Firſt,</hi> This is a complicated and <hi>multiplied ſin,</hi> and ſo comprehenſive an evil, that very many great tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are contained and linked together in it. S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſeems to think, that a reproaching Spirit<note n="(a)" place="margin">Baſ. in Eſai. c. 2.</note> might be the <hi>beginning</hi> of all ſin in the world; which may well be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted true, if we conſider it with reſpect to God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude under it that diſpoſition of mind from whence it flows.<note place="margin">Uncharitable evil-ſpeaking includes very many great ſins.</note> For the cloſing with that temptation, whereby the Serpent <hi>reproached</hi> the infinitely good God, was that which brought ſin and ruine on mankind. And it may well be thought, that the <hi>original tranſgreſſion</hi> of the fallen Angels, was their having <hi>ill thoughts</hi> of the higheſt good, and thereupon being forward to depart from God, and to draw others from him into the ſame defection. And this is the very root of reproaching, or that <hi>diſpoſition of ſpirit</hi> from whence it ariſeth.</p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:170758:38"/>
                        <p n="3">3. And this ought to be the more deteſted, becauſe the exerciſe of this ſin, includes in it many heinous offences. Now though <hi>one ſingle ſin,</hi> which any perſon willingly and wilfully purſues, is ſufficient to manifeſt him void of the fear of God, and eſtranged from the Chriſtian life; yet where the evil heart can readily chooſe, and the conſcience ſuffer, <hi>many notorious ſins</hi> to prevail, without being either ſo watchful, as to obſerve them; or ſo faithful, as to raiſe all the powers and faculties of the ſoul, to oppoſe them; here is a mind and conſcience, ſo much the more <hi>groſly defiled</hi> and vitiated. His condition is like that of the man into whom the <hi>unclean Spirit entring, taketh with him ſeven other Spirits,</hi> who enter in, and dwell there. And as that body is in a bad condition, in which divers dangerous diſeaſes are reigning; ſo that ſoul cannot be in any ſafe condition, where many great ſins do rule and govern it. And it is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this caſe, that a defaming temper, and the neglect of forſaking it by repentance, alwaies include a <hi>voluntary choice,</hi> and therefore hath in it, as all other ſins of choice have, a want of reverence to God and his laws.

And the neglect of the duties of this command, ſo far as concerns the terms of Gods promiſe, is a <hi>forfeiture</hi> of that right and title we might have to all the advantages of this life, and the bleſſing of God for our comfort and well-being here upon Earth.

Among the ſeveral expreſſions the Apoſtle uſeth, to declare the <hi>fruits of the Spirit,</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number of them tend to this purpoſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>Love, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs and meekneſs.</hi> But the unpeaceable and paſſionate temper takes up a great part of the <hi>works of the fleſh,</hi> mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20, 21. whereby we may diſcern, how much the true Spirit of Chriſtianity is concerned, in performing the duties of peace. But the reproaching and defaming others, is a practiſing ſtrife and contention, and a <hi>quarrelling</hi> with others though they be at a <hi>diſtance.</hi> I above obſerved, how the publick peace of Kingdoms hath been undermined hereby. And it is a thing ſo obvious, that the ſame method doth diſturb the quiet of <hi>private converſation;</hi> and alſo ſo diſorders mens minds, as to deprive them of that inward calmneſs of temper, which becomes a Chriſtian, that I need not undertake the proof thereof. And reproaches and cenſures have in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages and places, ſo ſadly and ſcandalouſly diſturbed the <hi>peace of the Church of God,</hi> and fomented diſcords therein, that the greateſt <hi>Schiſms and diviſions</hi> have continually in a great meaſure, had their birth, growth and continuance from this very cauſe. This, beſides the experience of latter ages, may appear from the inſtances of the <hi>Novatians, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts,</hi> and ſome others, mentioned in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. And now let any ſerious perſon conſider, whether there be not a very great <hi>pollution, and filth,</hi> in that practice

                        <p n="22">22.

And theſe things, together with a reſpectful demeanour to all Superiors, as they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in the life and <hi>practice of our Lord</hi> himſelf, will now fall under my conſideration. But concerning his example, ſome may poſſibly think with themſelves, that he was an <hi>extraordinary inſtance of ſuffering evil,</hi> and came into the World to bear the puniſhment of our ſins, and yielded up himſelf as the Lamb of God, to be a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> but all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are not to bear like ſufferings with him.

This is clearly aſſerted by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> telling us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22, 23. that <hi>Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us, leaving us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps: Who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth; who when he was reviled, he reviled not again.</hi> So that in theſe things, it is not only an <hi>hiſtorical truth,</hi> when we are told what Chriſt himſelf did; but this is alſo a <hi>rule,</hi> to acquaint us what we ought to do.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Contr. Apion l. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>Joſephus</hi> accounted it a great advantage, which the <hi>Jews</hi> had, for guiding them to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vertue, that when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Cretians</hi> inſtructed others in their duty by <hi>examples</hi> only; and the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and many others, did this only by <hi>precepts,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> made uſe of both theſe methods jointly. But in the Chriſtian Diſpenſation, we have both more <hi>excellent precepts,</hi> and an higher inforcement of them; and alſo a more <hi>exact pattern</hi> and example, than ever the <hi>Jews</hi> had. The life of Chriſt recommends thoſe practices, in which we are to follow him, to be the moſt <hi>honourable,</hi> and the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> undertakings; in that herein our lives are made conformable to the moſt <hi>glorious perſon,</hi> that ever appeared in our nature; and we herein do what he who is <hi>infinitely wiſe</hi> choſe to do. And his life alſo ſhews, that as he in our nature was a perfect pattern of meekneſs; ſo he can and will by his grace <hi>enable</hi> us, (if we reſolve piouſly and diligently to follow him, and ſerve him) to perform theſe duties alſo, though we attain not to the ſame perfection.

And what he did in the diſcharge of his <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory Office,</hi> though all Chriſtians are highly concerned therein, being intereſted in the benefits thereof, yet the performance of theſe actions, were ſo peculiar to himſelf, that none other are to do the like. Of this nature was his giving up himſelf <hi>to death,</hi> for the working our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to be a Propitiation for the ſins of the World. But yet it is obſervable, that in this <hi>ſingular act</hi> of his Mediatory Office, (and the like may be ſaid of others) that excellent <hi>temper of mind,</hi> in which he performed this work, is that wherein we ſtand obliged to follow him; and this will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to us <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>meekneſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. Thus with reſpect to <hi>God,</hi> whilſt he gave up himſelf to be a Sacrifice for ſin, this was a rare inſtance of <hi>obedience,</hi> to the will of his Father, even in the moſt difficult perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; and of <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to the pleaſure of his Father, in drinking that Cup which he gave him to drink without any murmuring or repining. And in theſe things it is our duty to follow him, and that the <hi>ſame mind be in us which was in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 2.5.-8. And with reſpect to <hi>man,</hi> this his Prieſtly action of making atonement, was performed out of the greateſt <hi>love</hi> to us: and it contained the higheſt expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and evidences of this love, in that he was willing to do ſo much, and to bear ſo much for men, who were ſinners and <hi>enemies;</hi> and alſo in that he did thereby effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for them the greateſt good. And here we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170758:49"/>to imitate him, and to <hi>walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us, an offering and a Sacrifice to God, for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour,</hi> Eph. 5.2. And towards them who were his cruel and <hi>inhumane enemies,</hi> who both crucified and reviled him; in his great ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when <hi>in his own body he did bear our ſins,</hi> he expreſſed a temper of <hi>eminent meekneſs,</hi> patience and kindneſs, and herein we are commanded to <hi>follow his ſteps, who when he was reviled, he reviled not again,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21, 23. And beſides this inſtance, in what other things we are not to imitate the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular actions</hi> of our Lord, there are yet ſome general conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with reſpect to the <hi>Spirit and temper</hi> of mind, in which they were done, that are of great uſe for our imitation.

And if we meet with them who work us evil, and rail againſt us, the rule of Chriſtian practice is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>not rendring evil, for evil, or railing for railing, but contrariwiſe bleſſing.</hi> And theſe and other ſuch like precepts, are ſo excellent and amiable, that if the meekneſs, and innocency and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which Chriſtianity requires, did univerſally prevail, and obtain in the World, it would make the Society of mankind wonderfully more <hi>ſweet, delightful and comfortable</hi> than it is, and their converſe would be free from the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and venome of the old Serpent.

And then much more ought we to practiſe theſe duties, ſince we deceive our ſelves, if we think the evil we undergo, whether of this kind or of any other, is not <hi>deſervedly ordered</hi> to us, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the general diſpoſing of all things, by Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.

                        <p n="52">52. Nor is this interpretation, which admits ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of blame, in the expreſſion of the Apoſtle, inconſiſtent, as I conceive, with the <hi>promiſes</hi> of our Saviour to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,<note place="margin">The great aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Apoſtles conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> when they ſhould be brought into the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> and before <hi>Governours and Kings,</hi> for his names ſake; that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt ſhould teach them in the ſame hour, what they ought to ſay,</hi> Luke 12.12. and that he <hi>will give them a mouth and wiſdom, which all their adverſaries ſhall not be able to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay or reſiſt,</hi> Luk. 21.15. For 1. It may be conſidered, that due <hi>diſpoſitions</hi> are requiſite, for obtaining the benefit of any of Gods promiſes, and his ſpecial guidance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſudden complyance with ſome <hi>haſtineſs of temper,</hi> might for the preſent, hinder the fulleſt obtaining the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of that promiſe.

The thing mainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in theſe promiſes, is, that the Spirit of God ſhould ſo guide and aſſiſt the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> (and others, as S. <hi>Stephen</hi>) in their bearing witneſs to Chriſtianity, before Rulers and Governours, that they ſhould not be <hi>aſhamed</hi> to own the truth, and that they ſhould be enabled to make it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, with ſuch <hi>evidence,</hi> as ſhould baffle and confound their <hi>adverſaries,</hi> who could not deny or diſprove the truth, of what they alledged in their teſtimony. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> did thus confound them, who oppoſed his Doctrine in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Act. 22.1-22. <hi>chap.</hi> 23.1, 6-9, 11.3. Whereas the only thing in any wiſe <hi>amiſs,</hi> in what the Apoſtle ſaid, was, that there fell from him a ſudden ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170758:67"/>too much <hi>reflective</hi> upon a Governour; it may be here noted, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That theſe his words ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear all of them to be <hi>truth,</hi> and the fault in them was, they were uttered with ſome <hi>paſſionateneſs</hi> of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and without ſufficient reverence in the <hi>manner of expreſſion. Secondly,</hi> By his <hi>recalling</hi> ſuch words as theſe, and owning his ſurprize therein; the tenderneſs of his <hi>conſcience,</hi> and the ſtrictneſs of his <hi>doctrine,</hi> concerning the honouring of Rulers, and againſt the leaſt word of <hi>undue diſreſpect</hi> towards them, is in a more eminent manner ſet down, for the inſtruction and guidance of all Ages, than if there had been no appearance at all, of any thing blamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his former expreſſion. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This is the more remarkable, becauſe this his <hi>reflexion</hi> upon, and <hi>retracting</hi> what he had thus ſpoken, as alſo the Doctrine he urgeth thereupon, was no doubt under the guidance of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> which our Saviour had promiſed in this caſe, and ſo makes his Example in this particular, to be a <hi>neceſſary pattern</hi> for every Chriſtian, that if he ſhould offend in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he ought to retract and own his <hi>fault,</hi> in the leaſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of his expreſſion.</p>
                        <p n="53">53. From this Practice and Doctrine of the Apoſtle, I ſhall further obſerve,</p>

And if one <hi>ſingle</hi> reflective expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not allowable in him, who was commanded to be <hi>ſmitten againſt law,</hi> and had no intention of defaming Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the ſame (and much more the frequently repeated ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering <hi>deſigned reproaches</hi>) is far more blameable in them,

                           <hi>Governour of Syria.</hi> And <hi>Ananias</hi> was ſo far inferiour to <hi>Felix</hi> in his Authority, that he with the other Synedrial Elders, appeared upon ſummons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>tribunal of Felix,</hi> as an Higher Court, to deſire judgment againſt Saint <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 24.1.

                           <hi>preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> after he had ſpoken the former words, and as ſoon as he had conſidered them, and was enquired of, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, he made no demurr or <hi>delay;</hi> but forthwith he forwardly and readily, owned the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and <hi>unlawfulneſs</hi> of ſuch expreſſions.

                        <p n="56">56. Now I think that what I have ſaid, is not inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, for my Expoſition of theſe words, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them to be a <hi>ſignal example,</hi> of acknowledging the <hi>fault, of any indecent expreſſion</hi> towards a Superiour.

And it is a thing too plain to be denied,<note place="margin">Hartful errors are too much prevailing.</note> that in this age, divers perſons and parties entertain thoſe errors and <hi>corruptions</hi> in matters of Religion, which deſerve to be ſharply cenſured and ſpoken againſt. 'Tis generally known, that the ſeveral parties, and different profeſſions, do condemn one another; and it may well become them to conſider, whether they have <hi>ſufficient ground,</hi> for the Cenſures they paſs on others, and whether they proceed therein in a due <hi>Chriſtian temper</hi> of Spirit, and alſo whether there be not any juſt foundation, for the <hi>blame</hi> themſelves meet with from others. Wherefore I ſhall make ſome impartial enquiry into ſome of the ſeveral parties of men, who divide the profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion. And ſince they who ſtrictly adhere to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> lie under
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170758:79"/>an infamous character from others, I ſhall firſt enquire,<note place="margin">An account of the things diſcourſed of in the following Chapters.</note> whether they may not be juſtly accuſed, of ſuch things as deſerve great condemnation and cenſure.

En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether they be not guilty of that, which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of blame. And if any of theſe ſeveral parties be no further ſpoken againſt, than they deſerve blame, and this be alſo ordered according to the Chriſtian Rules, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered above, this is not a <hi>ſinful reproaching,</hi> but a judging righteouſly and according to truth.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. And I here ſeriouſly profeſs, that there is no duty I eſteem my ſelf more obliged to practiſe, than to have an <hi>univerſal kindneſs</hi> to all men. And therefore I ſhall be ſo far, from willingly charging any ſort of men, with what they are not guilty of, that while I write ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of things blameable, among ſeveral parties of men, it is with a mixture of <hi>hearty ſorrow,</hi> that ſo much evil ſhould prevail in the world, and that ſo many perſons (divers of whom intend well) ſhould be led away thereby. And I <hi>humbly beſeech Almighty God,</hi> of his mercy and goodneſs, to bleſs and give good ſucceſs to all thoſe labours, which are undertaken to guide men, into the right wayes of truth and peace.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170758:81"/>thoſe Arguments of which I ſhall diſcourſe. But yet I think, ſuch Remarks as I ſhall make, may be of ſo much uſe to ſome perſons, as to give them a ſatisfactory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, how neceſſary it is to avoid the <hi>Romiſh</hi> groſs Errors.</p>

                              <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall enquire into the <hi>principles,</hi> and allowed practices of <hi>ſedition</hi> and diſturbance, againſt peace and good order of the Church and the world. Here I ſhall not need to prove, that true Religion and the Chriſtian temper, greatly promotes <hi>peaceableneſs,</hi> and eſtabliſheth <hi>juſtice</hi> and righteouſneſs in the earth. And that the doing <hi>wrong</hi> and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170758:81"/>injury, the proſecuting unjuſt claims, and <hi>invading</hi> the rights and properties of others; as alſo the embroiling any part of the World in diſcord and confuſion, in <hi>wars and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,</hi> and in Sedition and Rebellion, is exceeding contrary to our holy Religion. For the true principles of Morality, and the <hi>light of nature,</hi> will direct men who are not influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by intereſt and paſſion, to condemn and deteſt ſuch things as theſe. Wherefore taking this for granted, I ſhall in the firſt place reflect on the injurious demeanour of them at <hi>Rome</hi> towards <hi>ſecular Princes,</hi> in claiming to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Biſhop, an <hi>univerſal Soveraignty</hi> over Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with a Power to depoſe them, and diſpoſe of their Kingdoms.

The <hi>Romiſh</hi> claim is like that of the Tempter, who, concerning the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them, ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.5, 6. <hi>All this is delivered unto me, and to whomſoever I will, I give it;</hi> and it hath alſo a parallel title, which bears it ſelf up, upon confident <hi>uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,</hi> vain boaſting, and <hi>falſe pretences:</hi> Yet they who are thorough Papiſts muſt acknowledge this.</p>

And <hi>Ledeſima</hi> the Jeſuit acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, that when the Proteſtants took counſel for the tranſlating the Scriptures, and the diſperſing them abroad, this was a moſt apt and fit means to promote their intereſt;<note n="(b)" place="margin">ibid. c. 1.</note>

                           <p n="20">20. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If ſome men do miſcarry by their <hi>vanity, in wreſting</hi> the Scriptures to ſerve their errors, this is no juſt reaſon to prohibit the general uſe of a thing ſo excellent. If ſome men eat to ſurfet themſelves, or uſe their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings to abett error, and to cheat others by over-reaching them; or ſhall yield their eyes to behold vanity, their ears to be pleaſed with lewd diſcourſe, or their wills to chuſe evil; muſt the greater part of men be <hi>forbidden</hi> to eat, to conſider, or to chuſe any thing at all, and muſt their eyes be blindfolded, and their ears ſtopped, leſt they ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe them to evil?

                           <p n="21">21. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Scriptures read with <hi>piety and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> are excellently fitted to improve thoſe who read them, in <hi>wiſdom and goodneſs.</hi> And the goodneſs and <hi>purity</hi> which they recommend, and the <hi>eternal intereſts</hi> they propoſe, and the <hi>authority of God</hi> they bring along with them, have a great influence, through the grace of God there tendred, to work theſe humble and pious diſpoſitions.

                           <p n="22">22. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The wiſdom of God hath thought fit, to place man in ſuch a condition <hi>in this world,</hi> even under the Covenant of grace, that he is not out of <hi>all capacity of offending,</hi> in any caſe or circumſtances. They had a great priviledge who heard the words of the Goſpel, from the mouth of the <hi>holy Jeſus</hi> himſelf, or his Apoſtles; but this great bleſſing might be ill uſed by bad men, who were far from being benefitted thereby, if they were perverſe and obſtinate. And they who enjoyed theſe great advantages, if they were not careful and diligent to make a good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of them, were the <hi>more highly guilty,</hi> and under the more heavy condemnation.

For the whole exerciſe of Divine worſhip, is not only to <hi>ſeek for bleſſings</hi> from God, but alſo to praiſe him and <hi>glorifie</hi> him, which the people cannot particularly join in, and go along with, unleſs they underſtand what is expreſſed in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

The ways aſſigned by the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> to declare how the Saints departed are acquainted with things here below, eſpecially ſo far as to diſcern the ſpecial motions of the minds of all particular perſons, are but expreſſions of great words without evidence: and the <hi>ſpeculum Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> may as well ſerve to ſhew that the <hi>Angels</hi> in glory, were from the beginning of their confirmation in happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs acquainted with all <hi>things future,</hi> by ſeeing the face of our heavenly Father, (when yet our Lord declares, they knew not the time of the <hi>day of Judgement</hi>) as that the <hi>Saints</hi> in glory, have ſuch a clear underſtanding of things and perſons in this world. Now if they underſtand not our requeſts and deſires, ſupplications directed to them, are not only <hi>imprudent,</hi> but an abuſe of Religious Worſhip, by employing a conſiderable portion of it, and of our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein, about that which at leaſt ſignifies nothing,

And to perform acts of Religion upon the uncertain ſuppoſition of this being true, (of which we can have no certain knowledge, and there is much to be ſaid againſt it) is to ſhew our ſelves too forward to run the hazard, of being guilty of this miſcariage.</p>

And we may reaſonably fear, leſt God ſhould account our giving ſuch honour to thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified creatures in Heaven, as to acknowledge them to know the <hi>deſires of the hearts</hi> of men, and addreſſing our ſelves to them thereupon, to be a miſplacing that honour, which is only due to himſelf, and our bleſſed Saviour; and this might bring us under his <hi>diſpleaſure.</hi> And when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how frequently the Apoſtle deſires the prayers of the <hi>Chriſtian Churches on earth,</hi> and directs them to <hi>pray for one another,</hi> and to ſend to the <hi>Elders of the Church,</hi> to obtain their prayers: I cannot but think, that he would have been as forward to have directed Chriſtians, to ſeek for the prayers of <hi>Saints departed</hi> (of which he ſpeaks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) if he had accounted that to be lawful and uſeful; and from hence it may ſeem highly probable if not certain, that the Souls departed, do <hi>not underſtand,</hi> and are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly affected, with the requeſts and deſires of men here below.

                              <hi>Chriſt took Bread, and diſtributing it to his Diſciples, made it his Body, ſaying this is my Body; that is, the figure of my Body: but there had been no figure, unleſs the Body had been in truth.</hi> Now the manner of his expreſſion concerning the <hi>figure of Chriſts Body,</hi> ſhews him not to have accounted the Body of Chriſt to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially, but repreſentatively in the Sacrament. And his <hi>manner of arguing,</hi> ſhews him not to have underſtood, or owned the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Tranſubſtantiation. For it might be ſaid to one who ſhould thus argue, and hold the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Principles, by one of the Diſciples of <hi>Marcion,</hi> that there is in the figure the <hi>appearance</hi> of ſuch a Body, which after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration is not <hi>real, viz.

The other thing I ſhall add is, that when in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Chriſtianity, the Pagans falſly aſperſed the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, with being ſo inhumanly ſavage, that in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Religious Aſſemblies, they <hi>murdered</hi> an Infant, and ſucked and drunk his <hi>blood:</hi> it was among other things anſwered by<note n="(f)" place="margin">Tert.

And the like may be ſaid of other accidents. 4. If it could be imagined, that the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine was aboliſhed by conſecration (though it is not uſual for the <hi>bleſſing of God</hi> to deſtroy, but preſerve the thing he bleſſeth) the accidents, or appearances thereof only remaining; and that the ſubſtance of Chriſts Body and Blood ſhould be there ſubſtituted, without any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal accidents, even this could not be <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> according to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> deſcription thereof.

                              <pb n="232" facs="tcp:170758:126"/>of a thing, the ſubject matter which muſt be ſuppoſed in the changing things is wholly removed.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. And 5. That there muſt be <hi>new matter</hi> continually prepared, in the Sacramental elements, out of which the true ſubſtance of the <hi>Body and Blood</hi> of Chriſt is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, this alſo includes manifeſt contradiction. For then the Body and Blood of Chriſt, muſt be ſuppoſed to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, out of a <hi>different matter,</hi> at a <hi>different time,</hi> and in a <hi>different manner</hi> from that Body, which was born of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> and in which he aſſumed our nature; and yet this Body which is ſo many ways differing, from that ſubſtantial Body, which is aſcended into Heaven, muſt be acknowledged to be ſubſtantially the ſame.

That when groſs corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions formerly prevailed in that Church, through the <hi>blindneſs and ſuperſtition</hi> of ignorant and degenerate ages, the politick governing part think it not expedient now, to acknowledge thoſe things for <hi>errors,</hi> leſt they thereby loſe that reverence, they claim to their Church, when they have once acknowledged it to have <hi>erred</hi> and not to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.

And how little any miſunderſtanding, upon the grounds laid down by the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> is like in this caſe to be available for their excuſe, I ſhall manifeſt by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing another caſe, which may well be eſteemed parallel hereunto. As our Saviour ſaid concerning the Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Bread, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> ſo there is a greater plenty of expreſſions in the Scriptures, which are as plauſible to confer Divine honour upon pious Chriſtians. They are ſaid to be <hi>partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> to be <hi>born of God,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">The <hi>Remiſh</hi> Adoration of the Hoſt paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd.</note> to be <hi>renewed after the Image of God,</hi> and that <hi>God dwelleth in them;</hi> and that <hi>Chriſt is formed in them, and is in them,</hi> and that they are <hi>members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones,</hi> and with reſpect to them he ſaid to <hi>Saul, why perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt thou me?</hi> and he will ſay to others, <hi>I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Spirit of God dwells in them.</hi> Now if from ſuch expreſſions as theſe, any ſort of men ſhould give Divine Worſhip to every Saint (in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that fond notion of ſome <hi>Fanatick</hi> heads, that they
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170758:130"/>are Godded with God, and Chriſted with Chriſt) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to thoſe <hi>in Heaven,</hi> as well as to thoſe <hi>on Earth,</hi> and thereby multiply the objects of Divine Adoration, really beyond all the Polytheiſm of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> I doubt not, but they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would account this <hi>abominable Idolatry.</hi> Nor would they think it ſufficient here to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that theſe worſhippers own only <hi>one true God,</hi> and give Divine Worſhip to the Saints, only becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them to receive a new Divine Nature in becoming Saints, and to put on Chriſt, and to be changed into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſubſtance of that one God; and though this may ſeem as contrary to <hi>ſenſe and reaſon</hi> as Tranſubſtantiation doth, they therefore <hi>believe</hi> it, becauſe God hath ſaid it, (if their manifeſtly miſtaken ſenſe of Scripture be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and they can confidently rely on his word. And if we compare theſe two together, the <hi>grace</hi> of the Sacrament is very excellent, but it is that which is to be communicated to the <hi>communion of Saints,</hi> and conferred upon them. But the nature of the <hi>pious Chriſtian,</hi> is ſo much advanced above that of the <hi>Sacramental elements,</hi> that that muſt be confeſſed to be true, which was affirmed by Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi>

But becauſe this Chapter hath been already very large, I ſhall wave many things which might have been inſiſted on, and ſhall only conſider a few things, which have a chief reſpect unto the Pope himſelf. That the claim of the <hi>Papal Supremacy</hi> is in all the branches thereof groundleſs, I have ſomewhat declared in the firſt Section of this Chapter, and more fully in another Diſcourſe there referred unto. And that this is adapted to exalt the <hi>Papal dignity,</hi> grandure and Soveraignty, and to bring in vaſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues</hi> for its ſupport, needs not be ſuggeſted to any conſidering men. And the Popes pretence to be S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> ſeems not to be ordered with plain and honeſt ſincerity, in his firſt entrance thereupon. For at the time of his <hi>Coronation,</hi> among other Rites one of the laſt is, that<note n="(c)" place="margin">Sacr. Cerem. l. 1.

                              <note place="margin">Some things in the form of the Papal Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obſerved.</note> 
                              <hi>but what I have, that give I you.</hi> Now it ſeems not very fair and upright dealing, that the Pope by being advanced to his See, ſhould pretend himſelf to be a Succeſſor of S. <hi>Peters po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty;</hi> eſpecially when in order to his expreſſing thus much, there is care taken before-hand, that he muſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly avoid, the having all <hi>ſilver or gold</hi> in his hand. If S. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf had been known to have done thus, when he uſed thoſe words, this would have been looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in him, as a <hi>cheat and impoſture;</hi> which is one of the firſt things declared by his pretended Succeſſor, in ſuch a caſe where he might <hi>uprightly and infallibly</hi> have ſpoken truth. And a like abuſe of holy Scripture is in that other Rite at his Coronation, which goes immediately before this; when the Pope is <hi>ſat down,</hi> or almoſt <hi>lies along,</hi> upon a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Seat at the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> which Seat is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Stercoraria,</hi> and one of the Cardinals lifts him up<note n="(d)" place="margin">ibid.</note> uſing thoſe words in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.7, 8. <hi>Suſcitat de pulvere egenum, &amp; de ſtercore erigit pauperem, ut ſedeat cum principi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, &amp; ſolium gloriae teneat.</hi> Where what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

                              <note place="margin">Infallibility calculated for deſign.</note> This is a ſtrange claim, in ſuch a Church, where there are ſo many <hi>palpable errors,</hi> contrary to the Doctrine of the Scriptures, and the ancient Church. But this pretence mightily ſerves their <hi>intereſt:</hi> for if this be once believed and received, all their other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors muſt thereupon be received with great veneration, as being founded upon the <hi>higheſt evidence;</hi> ſince no evidence can be above <hi>infallible certainty;</hi> and there can be no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt it, but what appears to be ſuch is a <hi>miſtaken fallacy;</hi> and therefore no doubts ought to be admitted: for there cannot be any need of <hi>reforming</hi> the Doctrine of ſuch a Church. By this method alſo, ſo far as men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, they are kept in a <hi>peaceable ſubjection,</hi> but in a way of fraud, and neglect of truth. We account all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and prudent ways, to promote peace with truth, to be deſireable. But if <hi>ſtedfaſtneſs in errors,</hi> ſuch as thoſe of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> or of any Hereticks or Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, be more deſirable than to underſtand or embrace the truth, then may the devices of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded, which have any tendency to promote <hi>peace.</hi> And yet indeed all their other projects would ſignifie little, if it were not for the great ſtrictneſs and <hi>ſeverity of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> This pretence to Infallibility, is in the conſequence of it <hi>blaſphemous,</hi> becauſe as it pretends to be derived from God, it makes him to approve, and <hi>patronize</hi> all their groſs errors, and Heretical Doctrines. And if any other perſons ſhould have the confidence, to require all they ſay to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon their authority, as unqueſtionable and <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

For a General Council having reſpect to the whole <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and not being confined to the particular <hi>Roman</hi> limits: The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can upon this principle, plead no more for any <hi>Infallibility</hi> reſident in it, than the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> or the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> may do.

                              <note place="margin">Of Indulgences, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls from Purgatory thereby.</note> I ſhall conſider the pretended power, of <hi>ſecuring</hi> offenders from <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or <hi>releaſing</hi> their ſouls out of it, partly by the <hi>Prieſts Maſſes,</hi> and chiefly by the <hi>Popes Indulgences,</hi> and being intereſted thereby in that <hi>treaſure</hi> of the Church, which he hath power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe. For the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> tell us, that as there is in ſin a <hi>fault,</hi> and in mortal ſins an obligation to eternal puniſhment, which is diſcharged in the Sacrament of <hi>Penance and Abſolution;</hi> ſo there is an obligation to <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhment</hi> even in venial ſins, and if this be not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently undergone in this life, by way of ſatisfaction, it muſt be made up by the <hi>ſufferings of Purgatory.</hi> And thus a model is contrived and drawn up, to ſhew how ſinners may eſcape theſe evils of ſin, without amendment. Now ſin indeed is of that pernicious and hurtful nature in every reſpect, that by reaſon of it, God ſometimes <hi>puniſheth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> and Families, even after true repentance, and receiving
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170758:136"/>the perſon into his particular favour; and ſuch were the judgements on <hi>Davids Houſe,</hi> after his Murther and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.

This in the ordinary diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the ancient Church, was performed before the Church gave <hi>Abſolution,</hi> which oft included the ſevere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of divers years; and this was the <hi>Exomologeſis</hi> oft mentioned in <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian.</hi> And if in <hi>danger of death,</hi> ſuch penitents were reconciled, who had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated their penitential exerciſes,<note n="(f)" place="margin">Conc.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170758:139"/>out of Purgatory. For if there were any ſuch thing as <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> and any ſuch <hi>Treaſury</hi> in the Church of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and any power left to the Church to diſpenſe theſe at pleaſure to them who want a ſhare in them (in all which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church runs into ſtrange exorbitancies) there can be no reaſon to <hi>appropriate</hi> this power to the Pope, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we will call a device of Policy to exalt the dignity of the <hi>Roman See,</hi> a Reaſon. Their Writers grant, that <hi>other Biſhops</hi> may give to the living ſome Indulgences, but this<note n="(a)" place="margin">Laym. ubl ſup. c. 4. n. 2.</note> to the <hi>ſouls departed,</hi> and with reſpect to Purgatory, they make peculiar to the Pope. And both their private Authors, and the Bulls of Indulgence themſelves, found this Authority in the <hi>power of binding and looſing,</hi> and of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and retaining ſins,</hi> (which indeed contains an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and great authority, which deſerves to be better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but is groſsly abuſed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church) and therefore in this ſpecial <hi>caſe,</hi> every <hi>Prieſt</hi> hath as much a right to claim this authority, as the Pope himſelf; ſince he can do altogether as much in this caſe. The order of <hi>Prieſthood</hi> is acknowledged to be the <hi>higheſt order</hi> in the Eccleſiaſtical Offices, by the great Patrons of the Papal power, and is ſo declared in<note n="(b)" place="margin">de Ord.

But that the power of <hi>delivering ſouls</hi> out of Purgatory, by the Benefit of Indulgences, may ſtill be reſerved to the Pope, they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> declare, that the grant of Indulgences is<note n="(c)" place="margin">Bell. de Ind. l. 1. c. 11. Laym. ubi ſup. c. 1. n. 4.</note> not from the power of <hi>order</hi> but of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,</hi> and thereupon they place it in the Pope alone. But as to this caſe of delivering ſouls out of Purgatory, they forget themſelves when they again aſſert<note n="(d)" place="margin">Bell ib. c. 14. q. 2.

But thus much
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170758:140"/>can be alſo done, according to their Doctrine, by every <hi>Prieſt,</hi> who offereth the Sacrifice of the Maſs,<note n="(e)" place="margin">Conc.

OUr <hi>Diſſenters</hi> do not only lie under the Cenſure of private perſons, but even of our publick Laws and Conſtitutions; and therefore I ſhall faithfully and calmly without prejudice enquire, Whether there be not in them juſt and great cauſe of blame. Now theſe are not all of one Body ſo much as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are, (though they alſo have their different parties) but are more divided in their ſeveral ways of Communion and profeſſion; and are only united ſo far, as to eſpouſe the ſame general intereſt againſt our eſtabliſhed Government. And therefore that I may be the more clear and impartial, I ſhall firſt take ſome view of the ſeveral moſt famed Parties of them ſeparately and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly; and then conſider them jointly.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. And it is a matter of ſad reflection, that when the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chriſtian zeal contended ſo much for that Unity which our Religion earneſtly injoineth, the Spirit of Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath ſo far prevailed amongſt them who withdraw from our Church; that beſides their unwarrantable ſeparation from it, great numbers of them have run into other ſelect
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170758:141"/>and diſtinct parties, and many of them very monſtrous. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerved that when the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> forſook the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Cont. Epiſt. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. l. 3. c. 4. &amp; lib. de Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ. n. 69.</note> they fell into divers parties among themſelves, <hi>inter ipſos multa facta ſunt ſchiſmata, alii atque alii ſeparant,</hi> and of theſe the <hi>Maximinianiſts</hi> were the moſt inonſiderable. And amongſt us we had formerly wretched improvements of <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> into the lewdneſs of the <hi>Ranters;</hi> of ſeditious Principles, into the fierceneſs of the <hi>Fifth Monarchy men;</hi> and of ſeparation into <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> which is fartheſt removed from the Communion of the Chriſtian Church, and from many weighty points of the Chriſtian Doctrine. The giddy progreſs of ſeparation was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of in this Kingdom by one who (if I miſtake not) is now not only a practiſer, but a Patron thereof, who not amiſs reſembled it<note n="(b)" place="margin">J.

And the ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of our diviſions is ſo manifeſt, that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that<note n="(c)" place="margin">Of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Love, p. 2.</note> it will be granted, that the Glory of God, the Honour of Chriſt, the progreſs of the Goſpel, with the Edification and peace of the Church, are deeply concerned in them, and highly prejudiced by them. And ſince the ſeveral parties condemn and diſapprove each other, it is manifeſt from thence that all of them (at moſt one only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) muſt be juſtly blameable for proceeding upon falſe Principles, and unſound Aſſertions. And if any ſeparating party can juſtifie it ſelf, it muſt be able to plead truly, and manifeſt, that the Church from which it departs, is ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in Doctrine or Worſhip, that it cannot Communicate therewith without ſin; and that its differing from it is founded upon its caſting off ſuch things as are really ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and evil, ſtill retaining and embracing all ſuch things as are true and good, even all the rules of Faith and Life, and due Order, which the Chriſtian Religion doth direct and include.</p>
                           <pb n="264" facs="tcp:170758:142"/>
                           <p n="3">3. Beginning with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I might take notice of their want of ordinary civil and courteous behaviour, and outward expreſſions of reverence to Governours; when Chriſtianity injoins kindneſs, humility, courteouſneſs, and the due expreſſions of them to all men, and honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to be given to Superiors. I might alſo mention their condemning the uſe of an Oath, even in judicial proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which if rightly undertaken, is an act of Religion in a ſolemn acknowledging the Omniſcience and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; and is the moſt effectual way for the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of truth, the maintaining juſtice, preſerving rights, and ending ſtrife. But waving very many blameable errors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived amongſt them, I ſhall inſiſt on four things, which their Teachers have both in their Writings and Diſcourſes, vigorouſly aſſerted; which are of ſuch a nature, that thoſe who embrace theſe Principles, and practiſe according to them, may well be eſteemed to be as far from true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, as any perſons who pretend to the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Yet in ſo wild and Enthuſiaſtick a Sect, I do not undertake to give aſſurance that they in all things do all of them hold the ſame opinions, but do hope ſome of them may be drawn off from ſome of theſe evil Doctrines and Poſitions.</p>
                           <p>Here I ſhall obſerve,</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Their denial of, and caſting reproachful expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon the Holy and Glorious Trinity. The acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Trinity is a great part of the Chriſtian Faith, our Creed directing us to believe in <hi>God</hi> the Father Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his only Son our Lord, and in the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</hi> And<note n="(d)" place="margin">Conc.

And this Chriſtian Faith is not only contained in, and plainly deduced from the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; but is ſummarily expreſſed in that form of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Baptiſm which our Saviour eſtabliſhed, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170758:142"/>his Apoſtles <hi>to Baptize in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And this Baptiſmal form which the Holy Scriptures expreſs, is ſo conſiderable a teſtimony to the Doctrine of the Trinity, that many of thoſe Hereticks who denied the Trinity, thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerned not to own this generally eſtabliſhed form of Chriſtian Baptiſm, but boldly undertook to innovate and change that form our Lord had ordained, and his Church from him<note n="(e)" place="margin">Juſt.

                           <p n="5">5. But beſides what might be cited out of ſome of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books againſt the Trinity, I ſhall take the liberty to give a little account of what my ſelf hath formerly been concerned in. Almoſt three and twenty years ſince, ſome of the chief <hi>Quakers</hi> being buſie in theſe parts, two of their Principal Teachers ſent to me <hi>Nine Queſtions,</hi> or <hi>Poſitions</hi> rather, challenging me to diſpute with them; the firſt of which was againſt the three Perſons of the Deity, and the other took in all thoſe things I here diſcourſe of againſt the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170758:143"/>
                              <hi>Quakers,</hi> with more alſo. I then accepted this challenge, and we went through all theſe nine in three days diſcourſe. In the firſt day they plainly declared themſelves againſt the three Perſons of the Trinity; much as they had done about the ſame time in their Conference with<note n="(k)" place="margin">The <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> diſarm'd.</note> Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> at <hi>Cambridge.</hi> At that time in the Year 1659, I had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of charging <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> in the preſence of <hi>George Fox,</hi> and as great a number of other Witneſſes as the ſpecious room in which we were could contain, with as horrid and blaſphemous words againſt the Trinity as I ever read or heard of, which were contained in a Book written by him, and three other <hi>Quakers</hi> againſt one Mr. <hi>Tounſend,</hi> which was Intituled <hi>Iſhmael and his Mother caſt out.</hi> I even tremble to write the words, which the licentiouſneſs of thoſe times gave way to,<note n="(l)" place="margin">Iſhmael, &amp;c. p. 10.</note> 
                              <hi>The three Perſons which thou wouldſt divide out of one like a Conjurer, are denied, and thou ſhut up with them in perpetual darkneſs, for the Lake and the Pit.</hi> But he neither did nor could deny that this wicked aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was written and publiſhed by him and his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and the ſame thing was urged againſt him out of the ſame Book at the Conference at <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="6">6. Sometime after this, as if they had a mind to ſhew themſelves particularly zealous in the oppoſition of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Trinity, I received a paper<note n="(m)" place="margin">Directed to them, that affirm that there are three diſtinct Perſons in the Godhead, and that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the firſt, and the Word the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the Spirit the third: and that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten as to his Godhead.</note> of Five <hi>Queries,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very many branches under them, wholly levelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctrine of the Trinity, and ſubſcribed by <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>George Fox.</hi> And after I had returned an Anſwer to theſe, I received another large paper containing a long Harangue againſt the Holy Trinity, with <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s name alone ſubſcribed. In this paper which I have by me, it is declared, That to call three diſtinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Trinity, are Popiſh terms, and names the Papiſts do call the Godhead by. And concerning the eternal ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Son of God, it is there ſaid, Thou art one with the Papiſts in thy Doctrine in this thing, who in one of their Creeds do affirm, That Chriſt is God begotten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Worlds, when he was begotten as to his Sonſhip
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170758:143"/>and Manhood, and in time brought forth and manifeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Sons of men. Thus the moſt excellent truths may be miſrepreſented under odious names, and by errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons be called Popiſh.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their diſparaging the Holy Scriptures, which are the Rule of the Chriſtian Faith and Religion. The Scriptures contain the Prophetical and Apoſtolical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and this Doctrine is ſo certain and full, <hi>that if an Angel from Heaven preach any other Goſpel,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him to <hi>be accurſed.</hi> But their denying the Scriptures to be the word of God, (though they admit them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth) and their ſetting up the Light within them as their great Rule (both which are done frequently in their Writings and Conferences) is that which tends to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Authority of the Divine Writings, and to ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute another rule which is very defective, various and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and of dangerous conſequence. For if we conſider men as they truly are, the Light within them is the light of Reaſon and natural Conſcience, with thoſe improvements of knowledge and underſtanding which the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation hath made in the minde and ſentiments of men. Now though this be very conſiderable and needful to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to; yet to make this and not the Holy Scripture the main Rule and Guide in matters of Chriſtian Faith and life, is to prefer the light of Nature with the advantages it hath from Chriſtian converſe and Oral Tradition (or the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of truth from one to another, according to the thoughts, opinions and judgements of men, though mixed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errors and much uncertainty) before the infallible and unerring direction of the Holy Spirit in the Divine Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. And while the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> diſparaged the Scriptures in preferring the Traditions of their Elders; and the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church doth much to the ſame purpoſe, this Poſition of this Novel Sect is rather more unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than either of thoſe other practices. For though they eſtabliſhed miſtaken, falſe and erroneous Rules, yet the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170758:144"/>things dictated thereby were approved by the joint conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of many ſelect men, whom they eſteemed men of greateſt underſtanding; while this way directs every man, how corrupt and erroneous ſoever his mind may be, to ſet up his own thoughts and apprehenſions, to be a ſufficient Rule and Guide. And this muſt ſuppoſe every mans own conceptions to be infallible, though they be never ſo contrary to one another, or to the Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. But if we conſider the followers of this Sect according to the pretences of many of them, the Light within them, muſt have chief reſpect to ſome Enthuſiaſtick motions and impulſes. Such things were pretended to by the<note n="*" place="margin">Theod. Hiſt. Eccl. l. 4. c. 10.</note> 
                              <hi>Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> and other Hereticks of old: But beſides what may be ſaid againſt ſuch pretences in general, the manifeſt falſhood of them is in theſe particular caſes apparent from the plain errors they aſſert contrary to the ſure Doctrine of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And to ſet up any Enthuſiaſtick rule of Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth a diſparaging the Revelation of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, which is the right inſtruction in the true Chriſtian Religion; and this is ordinarily alſo blaſphemous againſt God, in falſly making him the author of ſuch errors by vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretending inſpiration, which are evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what he hath truly revealed by Chriſt and his Goſpel.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Their diſowning Chriſts ſpecial Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>to wit,</hi> the eſtabliſhing the Communion of his true Catholick Church, and his Miniſtry, and the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Their diſregard to the Communion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, and their frequent reproaches againſt it, and the Miniſters thereof, are very notorious. But I ſhall here chiefly inſiſt on what concerns the Sacraments, which Holy inſtitutions they generally diſuſe; and againſt the uſe of theſe their Teachers have both ſpoken and written. Now this is a thing ſo evil and of ſuch dangerous conſequence, that beſides the diſobedience to what our Lord hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170758:144"/>and commanded by his plain precepts, they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reject thoſe things which the Goſpel appoints to be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent means of Communion and Union with the Church and Body of Chriſt. Such things are both the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both that of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and that of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. <hi>chap.</hi> 10.16, 17. And this Union and Communion according to the ordinary method of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Diſpenſation is neceſſary to Memberſhip with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. And the diſowning and rejecting theſe things, is the refuſing the means of grace which God hath appointed, for the conveying the bleſſings of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and particularly the remiſſion of ſins, to ſuch perſons, who by performing the other conditions of the Covenant, are duly qualified for the receiving the ſame in the uſe of theſe adminiſtrations, <hi>Act.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. Our Lord appointed Baptiſm to be a part of the condition of obtaining ſalvation, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth and is Baptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And the ancient Chriſtians had ſuch an high eſteem thereof, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> begins his Book <hi>de Baptiſmo</hi> on this manner, <hi>Foelix Sacramentum aquae, quia ablutis delictis priſtinae caecitatis, in vitam aeternam liberamur; Happy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm, becauſe the faults of our former blindneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waſhed away, we are ſet free unto eternal life.</hi> And our Lord hath declared, that <hi>except we eat his fleſh, and drink his blood, we have no life in us,</hi> Joh. 6.53. and hath appointed the Holy Communion to be an eminent and peculiar way <hi>of eating his Body, and drinking his Blood.</hi> And what then can be ſaid for them who groſsly neglect, and eſpecially for them who declare againſt, and totally reject theſe Sacred Inſtitutions? And if under the Old Teſtament God was ſo highly diſpleaſed with him who neglected Circumciſion, as to denounce him to be <hi>cut off from his people,</hi> Gen. 17.14. and declared that they who attended not on the <hi>Paſſeover, ſhould bear their ſin,</hi> Num. 9.13. he cannot be pleaſed with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating thoſe Inſtitutions which are of an higher nature, being eſtabliſhed by the Son of God himſelf under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>

For this undermines all penitential exerciſes, which take in the great part of the true Chriſtian life; and makes void confeſſion of ſin, and ſorrow for it, together with prayer and application to the Sacrifice of Chriſt for remiſſion; and a diligent care of amendment. We acknowledge and aſſert that every pious Chriſtian doth overcome the power of ſin, ſo that he doth not ſerve it, but lives in the practice of good Conſcience towards God and man. This is ſuch a life that the Holy Scriptures ſpeak much of the excellency and real holineſs and purity thereof, and its freedom from ſin. And the ancient Eccleſiaſtical Writers, give large and high commendations thereof. <hi>Polycarp</hi> ſaith<note n="(n)" place="margin">Ep. ad Philip. p. 16.</note> that he who hath charity is free from all ſin: which hath ſome affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. <hi>he that loveth another, hath fulfilled the Law.</hi> And <hi>Origen</hi> ſpeaks of the Chriſtian man as being pure from ſin,<note n="(o)" place="margin">Cont. Celſ. l. 3. p. 148, 149.</note> and having left off to ſin; which is of like nature with not <hi>continuing any longer therein,</hi> Rom. 6.2. as having departed from a vicious, wicked and impure life. And the Chriſtian life is a perfect life, as it greatly outdoth the practice of evil men, and is in it ſelf excellent, and contains a reſemblance of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44-48. and as it is guided by the fear of God, and directed to the <hi>eſchewing evil, and doing what is juſt and good,</hi> Job 1.1. Pſal. 37.37.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. And every true Chriſtian doth and muſt perform all the neceſſary conditions in the Goſpel-Covenant for acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance with God, and obtaining Salvation; or otherwiſe he can never be ſaved. And the practice of Faith and true holineſs; the ſubduing luſts and evil affections; and being renewed after God, is included in theſe conditions. But the terms and conditions of the Goſpel-Covenant are not the ſame thing, but muſt be differently conſidered from the rules of duty which the Goſpel injoins. For a conſtant practice of every duty towards God and man, and a careful
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170758:145"/>performance of every moral precept without any tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof is injoined more highly under the Goſpel, than ever it was before. But the conditions of the Goſpel-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, are upon more mild and gentle terms of grace, than were contained under the foregoing Diſpenſations: for they admit and approve true uprightneſs and ſincerity of obedience, though there may ſome failings and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections attend it; and they allow of repentance, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe mercy and pardon to thoſe offenders who are truly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent. So that the rules of duty conſidered in their large extent, do ſo far ſhew what we are obliged to perform, that whenſoever we fail in the leaſt part thereof, we thereupon need the benefit of the pardoning mercy of God, and the atonement and expiation of our Saviour; to which when we diſcern our failing in the exerciſe of ſelf-reflexion, we are to apply our ſelves according to the directions of the Goſpel, with a pious and penitent behaviour. But the great and neceſſary conditions of the Goſpel and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, contain thoſe things which are of ſuch indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſable neceſſity to be performed and obſerved by us, that the mercy of God will never accept of thoſe who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them, nor will it pardon the omiſſion thereof. Such conditions under the Goſpel Revelation, are the embracing the Chriſtian Faith, the diligent exerciſe of a holy life, and under the ſenſe of our failings, an humble addreſs to God through Chriſt for his mercy, pardon and ſupplies of further grace, with penitential exerciſes.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. And in the beſt of men who exerciſe themſelves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently in piety and the diſcharge of a good conſcience, there may be many things wherein they fail and come ſhort of the exact performance of what they ought to do. And therefore our Saviour taught his Diſciples ordinarily to pray, <hi>forgive us our Treſpaſſes;</hi> and appointed that petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be part of that prayer which he directed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to uſe. Upon which words of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi>
                              <note n="(p)" place="margin">Cyp. de Orat. Dom.</note> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> obſerves, how every one is hereby taught and inſtructed that he offends every day, when he is

                              <note n="(q)" place="margin">Aug.

And in the Inſtitution of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> our Saviour tendred the Sacrifice of his Body and Blood to be received by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the continued adminiſtration of that Ordinance, for the remiſſion of ſins. All which doth manifeſt that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life and Goſpel-obedience, which is accepted upon the conditions of the Covenant of grace, is not an abſolute ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs obedience, though it doth include a real purity of heart, and integrity of converſation. And the pious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is ſometimes called perfect, with reſpect to that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to which he hath attained, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15, 16. and yet at the ſaid time in a different ſenſe is not acknowledged to be perfect, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. by reaſon of the defects which are ſtill remaining. Hence the Holy Scriptures oft ſpeak to this purpoſe, <hi>that in many things we offend all,</hi> and that <hi>there is no man that lives and ſins not, and</hi> that <hi>if we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi>

                           <p n="13">13. And we further aſſert and acknowledge, that in the Chriſtian ſtate there is alſo a perfection by way of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, in them who have arrived to greater degrees, and a more eminent height and growth in Chriſtian graces and vertues, than others: and this excellent ſtate is very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and ought to be diligently endeavoured by every pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

The imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of ſuch men as <hi>Aſa</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and others who are called perfect, are noted in the Scripture. And that ſame Epiſtle in which S. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks ſo much of him that is <hi>born of God</hi> that he <hi>ſins not,</hi> as having rejected a vicious and evil life, <hi>and being ſet free from the ſervice thereof,</hi> he alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares againſt him <hi>who ſaith he hath no ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.8. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects confeſſion of ſin, <hi>v.</hi> 9. and ſpeaking concerning thoſe who are in a true Chriſtian ſtate, ſaith, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt the righteous is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.2. And who, who examines himſelf, can pretend himſelf free from every diſorder in any paſſion or affection, from all failure in word or thought; and that he can be charged with no neglect of any duty at any time, either towards God or man, in any relation whatſoever, nor with any blameable defect in the manner of the performance thereof? And the pretence to perfection and ſinleſs practice is the more fond and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in this Sect, becauſe of the groſs and heinous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of judgment, and conſequently of practice which they are guilty of, together with many words of falſhood, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoriouſneſs or uncharitableneſs.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. Now the great hurt and danger of this opinion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning perfection is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it makes void ſuch duties as confeſſion, repentance, &amp; application to the benefits of Chriſts expiatory Sacrifice, which things are not only injoined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſtians by the frequent commands of the Goſpel; but are alſo propoſed as the conditions for obtaining the

If the Goſpel did not admit theſe gracious terms and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the ſtate of the beſt ſort of men would be miſerable. But S. <hi>John</hi> joins theſe two together, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Goſpel rule, that will not allow of any ſin, <hi>My little children theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſin not:</hi> and the gracious conditions of pardon through the merits of Chriſt; <hi>if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. IN diſcourſing of thoſe who are ordinarily among us called <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> I ſhall take no notice of many evil Opinions and cruel Practices, which thoſe who go under that name have been guilty of, eſpecially in foregin Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but ſhall confine my ſelf wholly to the conſideration of <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi> not in the ſtrict notion of the word, but as it is commonly underſtood amongſt us. And in this ſenſe it eſpecially includes <hi>Antipaedobaptiſm,</hi> as denying Infant-Baptiſm, and diſowning the perſons Baptized in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, from being truly Baptized, and thereby Members of the Church; and aſſerting thereupon, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170758:150"/>they ſhould be re-baptized. But the evil of this their oppoſition againſt the Baptiſm of Infants, conſiſteth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in three things.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Firſt,</hi> In that the foundation of this Opinion is untrue, and gives a falſe repreſentation of the grace of God in the New Covenant. For God by his grace, doth receive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants born in the Church, to be under his Covenant, and to partake of the benefits and bleſſings thereof: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to be admitted to that Ordinance, which is a Seal of that Covenant, and contains a particular tender and application of the benefits thereof unto thoſe who are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified to receive them. And ſince this Covenant owneth Infants to be Members of the Church of God, they ought not to be debarred from the ſolemn admiſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. When God made his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he extended it to him and to his Seed: and whereas God then appointed <hi>Circumciſion</hi> to be a token of this Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. and <hi>a Seal of the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> Rom. 4.11. he ſtill commanded that all the <hi>Males</hi> in their infancy ſhould be <hi>Circumciſed, Gen.</hi> 17.12. which is a manifeſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that they were intereſted in this Covenant made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> And this precept of Circumciſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Infant Males, continued in force until the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Saviour, and thereby Infants born in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, were owned and received to be members of that Church. Now our Saviours coming was not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Church to narrower limits, but to extend and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. And it may not be amiſs to obſerve, that the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves did generally acknowledge that the priviledge of having ſuch Children admitted into their Church in their infancy, whoſe Parents were members thereof, was not peculiar to that Nation alone, but did alſo belong to thoſe who from among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> became Proſelytes to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion. When they admitted the chief ſort of Proſelytes which were called the Proſelytes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170758:150"/>this was uſually done<note n="(a)" place="margin">Seld. de Syned. l. 3. c. 3. p. 34, 37-40. Hor. Hebr. in Mat. 3.6.</note> by Circumciſion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a kind of Baptiſm, or waſhing them (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their uncleanneſs in their <hi>Gentiliſm</hi>) and Sacrifice, as Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> and others have obſerved: who alſo have manifeſted from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> writers, that they did uſually admit Children, even Infants with their Parents. And if the Mother was admitted into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this ſort of Proſelytes when ſhe was with Child, that Child afterwards born, was ſuppoſed not to need any other waſhing, but if it was a Male, was received only by Circumciſion. And it alſo appears by the teſtimonies produced by the latter of theſe Writers<note n="(b)" place="margin">Hor. Heb. ibid.</note> that they ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily admitted the Infants of <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be Proſelytes, if they were taken into the care and education of <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> and this was agreeable to what God had eſtabliſhed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him who was born in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Houſe, or bought with money of any ſtranger not of his Seed.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. And that the New Teſtament doth particularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Infants into the Church of God, and giveth them a right to partake of the benefits of his Covenant, as well as the Old Teſtament did, might be juſtly preſumed, becauſe there is not any thing ſaid or done by our Saviour which doth exclude them, nor is there any thing declared by God, whereby he expreſſeth his altering the terms of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſo as in this particular to confine it into a leſs and ſtraiter compaſs under the Goſpel. But beſides this, there are plain expreſſions in the New Teſtament, that Infants are received as Members of the Church of God, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in the promiſes of his Covenant under the Chriſtian Diſpenſation. Our Saviour ſaith of them, that <hi>of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mar. 10.14. and S. <hi>Peter</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades the <hi>Jews, Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Repent and be baptized—for the promiſe is to you and to your Children;</hi> and the ſame thing may be inferred from other Texts of Scripture. And theſe expreſſions eſpecially conſidering what God had eſtabliſhed and injoined in the time of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do ſufficiently declare this ſenſe of the Goſpel-Covenant,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170758:151"/>that Children and Infants are included therein.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. And whereas the <hi>Judaizers</hi> did earneſtly contend with the Apoſtles, about the neceſſity of Circumciſion, and other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites to be continued in the Church, we read of no conteſt about the admiſſion of their Children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church. Had the Apoſtles and the Chriſtian inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution herein differed from the Rules received under the Old Teſtament, in not admitting Children into the Church of God; theſe men would no doubt as eagerly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the Apoſtles about this thing as about the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſince this was a branch of Gods ancient Covenant, and ſuch a branch as they could not but think to be of high concernment to themſelves and their Poſterity. But the Chriſtian Doctrine plainly acknowledgeth that Children were reputed holy, if but one of their Parents were Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans or Believers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. and therefore ſuch Children which otherwiſe had been unclean, were accounted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Church, by vertue of that relation they had to ſuch Believing Parents. And when the Apoſtles are ſaid to have Baptized perſons and all theirs, or all their Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, upon the conſideration now mentioned, it is not to be doubted but Children and Infants were included in theſe expreſſions, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.15. and <hi>v.</hi> 33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. and alſo in that other precept of <hi>Baptizing all Nations,</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them Diſciples,</hi> Mat. 28.19. And this will receive fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmation from the ordinary and uſual practice of the ancient Chriſtian Church in Baptizing Infants, which I ſhall by and by mention.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Indeed under the Goſpel it was neceſſary that adult perſons, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſhould firſt be taught the Chriſtian Doctrine, and own their belief thereof, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the practice of repentance and obedience, before they could be Baptized into the Chriſtian Church. But this gives no ſupport to them who oppoſe the Baptiſm of Infants; ſince even under the Old Teſtament, ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who being adult, were received as Proſelytes to the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:170758:151"/>
                              <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, were firſt to be acquainted with the Law of God,<hi>(d)</hi> and then to profeſs their owning and believing in the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                              <note n="(c)" place="margin">Selden. ubi ſup.</note> before they were admitted into that Church by Circumciſion, and other ſolemn Rites. And this reaſonable and neceſſary obſervation, with reſpect to thoſe who attained to years of diſcretion, was well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with their Circumciſing Infants: and the Divine Law injoined, that when ſtrangers were deſirous to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, and were admitted thereto, all their Males (and therefore even thoſe which were Infants) muſt be Circumciſed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. And thoſe words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> from which the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of <hi>Anabaptiſm</hi> have endeavoured to prove, that under the New Teſtament none (and therefore no Infants) are intereſted in the Goſpel-Covenant and Memberſhip of the Chriſtian Church, by being born of Chriſtian Parents, are greatly miſtaken. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. <hi>They are not all Iſrael, which are of Iſrael.</hi> v. 7. <hi>Neither becauſe they are the Seed of Abraham, are they all Children: but in Iſaac ſhall thy Seed be called.</hi> For, 1. Theſe words have no peculiar reſpect to the time and ſtate of the New Teſtament; but they give an account how the promiſe to the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was to be underſtood, from the very time in which it was made to <hi>Abraham.</hi> And the Apoſtle here ſhews, that this Promiſe and Covenant was particularly fixed upon <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his Family, <hi>v.</hi> 7. and then upon <hi>Jacob,</hi> v. 13. and yet then Infants were conſtantly Circumciſed. 2. The true ſenſe of theſe words is, that the Promiſe and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God, to and with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, did not bind him to continue all the poſterity of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> or other Sons of <hi>Abraham;</hi> nor yet the Poſterity of <hi>Eſau,</hi> to be his peculiar Church and people, though theſe were Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and lineally deſcended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> but had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Religion, Piety, Faith, and Obedience of their Father <hi>Abraham.</hi> And from hence the Apoſtle proves that the ſame promiſe can be no ſecurity to the <hi>Jews</hi> or the Poſterity of <hi>Jacob</hi> in their unbelief and diſobedience:
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:170758:152"/>but God can otherwiſe accompliſh his promiſe made to the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by accompliſhing it to them who walk in the ſteps of the Faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi> 3. As this true ſenſe is wholly alien from proving Infants not to be members of the Chriſtian Church; ſo the ſenſe impoſed upon them by the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> is neither agreeable to the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the ſcope of that place, nor to ſuch other expreſſions of the New Teſtament, as I have above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Opinion and Practice of <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi> is very uncharitable to Infants born in the Chriſtian Church, upon a double account. For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The conſequence of this Poſition will be to take away that great hope of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the true Principles of Chriſtianity do afford, concerning Chriſtian Infants dying in their infancy. I acknowledge that this conſequence concerning all Infants is not owned by thoſe who hold this erroneous opinion in denying Infant-Baptiſm, who run into other errors to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void this. But yet this is deducible from their Aſſertion; and therefore I charge this uncharitableneſs to be a proper conſequent of this opinion. For ſince Chriſtians are Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized into the <hi>Body</hi> or Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.12. and are thereby entred as members thereof: if Infants be denied to have any right to Baptiſm, or to be capable of being Baptized, they cannot then be owned to be members of the viſible Church of Chriſt, and parts of his Body. And they who are ſuppoſed to be excluded from the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church by Gods ſpecial inſtitution, and to be thereby made uncapable of being received as members thereof, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be preſumed to be admitted into memberſhip with the inviſible Church; if we conſider what God himſelf hath declared concerning the power of the Keys, and of Binding and Looſing upon Earth. And thoſe great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the New Covenant, of which eternal Salvation is the chief, belong to that Church, which is the Body of Chriſt, and to the lively members thereof: <hi>For Chriſt is
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170758:152"/>the Saviour of this body,</hi> Eph. 5.23. And this Body which is his Church, is that which he will <hi>preſent to himſelf, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither ſpot, nor wrinkle, nor any ſuch thing,</hi> v. 27. And whereas Baptiſm is the <hi>laver of regeneration,</hi> Tit. 3.5. if Infants are not capable of being partakers <hi>of that waſhing of water</hi> whereby the Church is <hi>cleanſed and ſanctified,</hi> Eph. 5.26. and of the laver of regeneration, and of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf alſo, <hi>they cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Joh. 3.3, 5.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. But this opinion is further uncharitable to Infants, in denying to them ſuch means of grace as the Goſpel of our Saviour doth afford them, and the Chriſtian Church hath from the beginning alwayes acknowledged to belong to them. All the Ordinances and ſpecial Inſtitutions of Chriſt tend to the great advantage and good of them who do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right partake of them, and are uſeful to their ſpiritual and eternal welfare and benefit; and ſo particularly is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Baptiſm. Of this I have particularly diſcourſed in<note n="(d)" place="margin">Libert. Eccleſ. B. 1. c. 5. Sect. 3.4.5.</note> another place. And as the Scriptures ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the great benefit of Baptiſm, with reſpect to regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and remiſſion of ſins; ſo whoſoever hath a due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for our Lord and Saviour, can by no means enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch low thoughts of his Inſtitutions, as to think them of no conſiderable uſefulneſs to them who duly receive them. But this piece of uncharitableneſs to Infants, is much worſe, and more hurtful and prejudicial to them than the former. For the opinion from whence the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conſequent was deduced, being untrue, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it ſelf is alſo falſe, and ſo hath no real influence or effect upon the ſtate of Infants, nor are damaged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, whereas they are truly prejudiced by being denied the means of grace.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. On this account the Chiriſtian Church in the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thereof, and in a continued ſucceſſion from thence to this time, hath admitted Infants to be Baptized, and thought it ſelf bound ſo to do. S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>

When <hi>Fidus</hi> had written to <hi>Cyprian</hi> his opinion, that Infants ought not to be Baptized within the ſecond or third day of their Birth, or until the eighth day, which was the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Circumciſion; though this opinion allowed and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> largely declares, that not any one of this Council did agree to this opinion; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them judged, <hi>Nulli hominum nato miſericordiam Dei &amp; gratiam denegandam, That the mercy and grace of God is to be denied to no Child of man,</hi> i. e. <hi>upon account of their age.</hi> And he there ſhews, that Infants from the time of their Birth, are not to be prohibited Baptiſm. And of how great conſequence they in thoſe early times judged <hi>Infant-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,</hi> is apparent from this expreſſion relating thereto,<note n="(h)" place="margin">ibid.</note> 
                              <hi>quantum in nobis eſt, ſi fieri poteſt, nulla anima perdenda eſt; as far as is in our power, if it be poſſible, no ſoul is to be loſt.</hi> The plain teſtimonies of <hi>Origen,</hi> both upon <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and of divers other Fathers and Councils might be added, to manifeſt the univerſal recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> in the Catholick Church. But this having been clearly and ſufficiently evidenced by the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Theſes of<note n="(i)" place="margin">Theſ.

                           <p n="11">11. But that learned man truly obſerves, that there is ſomething which may ſeem ſingular in ſome expreſſions of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> who though they deny not <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm,</hi> yet intimate the uſefulneſs of deferring the Baptiſm of Infants, and incline to perſwade the ſame. Now though any ſingular apprehenſion of one or two men
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170758:153"/>is not to be laid in the balance againſt the general ſenſe of the Church; I ſhall however obſerve ſomething further concerning the ſenſe of both theſe ancient Writers. <hi>Gr. Nazianzen</hi> doth indeed in his Oration<note n="(k)" place="margin">Orat. 40. p. 458.</note> concerning Baptiſm, adviſe, that if Infants be in no danger of death, their Baptiſm may be deferred till they be three years old, or ſomewhat leſs or more, that themſelves may hear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that Myſtery, and give anſwer. But though he might proceed upon a notion peculiar to himſelf, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that he was no favourer of <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi> becauſe in that very place, he both declares the lawfulneſs of Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Infants as they were Circumciſed the eighth day, and the profitableneſs of Baptiſm to them that die in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and alſo preſſeth the practice thereof when the Infant is in any danger. But beſides all this, it ſeems to me not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that theſe words of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> have reſpect to ſome ſpecial caſe, and probably to that which was then ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordinary and uſual in the Chriſtian Church concerning ſuch Infants, whoſe Parents were yet unbaptized, either continuing Catechumens according to the diſcipline of the Church, or elſe after their embracing Chriſtianity, did long by their own choice and neglect, defer their Baptiſm.

                              </gap>, and this he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends to be done before any evil be imbraced, as being greatly uſeful for the future life of the Child. 2. In the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170758:154"/>ſame Oration, he declares his judgement, that even In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants dying without Baptiſm,<note n="(n)" place="margin">p. 453.</note> ſhould not be admitted to future glory, though they would be free from future puniſhment. And therefore it cannot be ſuppoſed, that he would adviſe that to be ordinarily done, which might run a needleſs hazard of the loſs of future glory to Infants, in that caſe where they were certainly qualified for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Baptiſm, and being benefitted by it, as the Infants of Believing and Baptized Parents were. But in ſuch a caſe as that abovementioned, where there might be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs concerning ſuch Infants being in a capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Baptiſm, he might account that advice he gave, to be proper and uſeful. 3. Becauſe the Chriſtian Church did generally admit thoſe who were in the very entrance of their infancy, unto Baptiſm, and it cannot well be imagined that ſo peaceable a man as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> was, would adviſe againſt the general practice of the Chriſtian Church in ordinary caſes; while yet he profeſſedly allowed the lawfulneſs and uſefulneſs of that practice.</p>

But this place alſo may I ſuppoſe have a good account given of it, by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate and diſcipline of the Primitive Church. And therefore, 1. <hi>Pamelius</hi> thinketh,<note n="(p)" place="margin">In Tertul. de Bapt. n. 126.</note> that this might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be ſpoken concerning ſuch Infants, whoſe Parents were Infidels; but I had rather underſtand this alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe whoſe Parents were profeſſed Chriſtians, but not yet Baptized. 2. <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                              <note n="(q)" place="margin">c. 12, 13.</note> both in this very Book and elſewhere<note n="*" place="margin">&amp; de Anima c. 39, 40.</note>, aſſerts that Baptiſm is neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the priviledges of Chriſtianity, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he applys to Baptiſm, as other ancient Writers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally did, thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Except a man be born of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and of the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> And therefore he plainly aſſerts, <hi>Nemini ſine Baptiſmo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petere ſalutem.</hi> And this ſhews, that the advice of deferring Baptiſm, in perſons fitly diſpoſed to receive it, and further than the juſt rules of trial fixed in the ancient Church did
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:170758:154"/>require, was unreaſonable and dangerous. And this may incline us to think that he intended not to plead for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther procraſtinating Baptiſm, (ſo far as his words can be fairly reconciled to this ſenſe). And he ſeems plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſpeak his judgment, that the Infants of<note n="(r)" place="margin">de Anima ubi ſup.</note> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Parents were fitly qualified for Baptiſm. 3.

But all this ſeems to require the careful obſervance of that which the Primitive rules of order eſtabliſhed; that all thoſe who were born <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and were by Baptiſm to be ſolemnly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Chriſtian profeſſion, muſt firſt give evidence by due and ſufficient trial, both to themſelves and to the Church alſo, that they were ſtedfaſtly reſolved to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſerious practiſers of the holy rules of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an life. And till they had done this, he perſwades them not to put themſelves over forwardly upon Baptiſm, leſt they ſhould deceive themſelves and the Church too by fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their practice; for as he ſaith here,<note n="(t)" place="margin">ibid.</note>

If any perſon will contend that <hi>Tertullian</hi> intended to perſwade to a more general delay of Baptiſm, than what this fair account of his words doth admit; he muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge alſo, that he adviſeth this forbearance as well in the caſe of the adult, as of Infants. But though the very long deferring of Baptiſm was practiſed by ſeveral perſons, it was generally diſliked, by all the wiſeſt and beſt men in the Chriſtian Church. Hence the particular Fathers ſet themſelves vigorouſly to reprove and diſſwade this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, which was undertaken by ſeveral perſons upon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent accounts, inſomuch that many choſe to defer their Baptiſm until they had apprehenſions of approaching death, and then were Baptized in their Beds.

And thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now conſidered the cuſtom of the ancient Church, for the Baptizing Infants, we have from thence in complyance with the Scripture, a further confirmation thereof, and a ſufficient evidence that the Primitive Church were not, nor durſt be ſo uncharitable to Infants as to debar them of Baptiſm.</p>

For they who aſſert thoſe not to be owned right members of the Church who were Baptized in their infancy, unleſs they be Baptized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, do and muſt maintain that thoſe Churches can be no true Churches of Chriſt, whoſe members were Baptized only in their infancy, and thereupon paſs that heavy and unjuſt Cenſure upon the generality of all Chriſtian Churches ſince the time of the firſt founding them, that they are no true Churches.

And whatſoever may have any uſefulneſs towards piety and goodneſs, which any of theſe men may ſeem to aim at in a way of error, and with a various mixture of other things hurtful and evil; is provided for by us (if good rules be carefully practiſed) in a better manner, and in a way of truth. That every man ought to make Religion his own act, and make a free and voluntary profeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and yield his hearty conſent to ingage himſelf therein, and in the practice thereof, we aſſert to be very neceſſary in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are of age and capacity of underſtanding. And though Infants cannot do this in their infant ſtate; yet their future obligation is then declared on their behalf, and when they come to a ſufficient age, they are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to believe and to do what in their Baptiſm was promiſed and declared in their names. And this is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſolemnly promiſed by themſelves, when in their younger years they are confirmed, and they likewiſe in a ſacred manner ingage themſelves hereto, when at a fuller age they receive the holy Communion: and it would be of great advantage to the Church of God, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſes of piety, if theſe two offices were more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, ſeriouſly and devoutly attended upon.

                           <p n="6">6. But <hi>Firſt,</hi> This is contrary to what the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures declare, and all the ancient Churches of God, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably thereto, have practiſed concerning the right order and Government of the Church. What is more evident in the Scriptures than that the ſeveral Churches of Chriſtians were under the Authority and Government of the Apoſtles themſelves; which is ſufficient to manifeſt, that it was no Inſtitution nor intendment of Chriſt, that particular Churches ſhould not be ſubject to any Superior Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority. Nor was ſuch Governing Authority pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Apoſtles themſelves, but was by them thought requiſite to be committed to the care of others. Hence for inſtance, <hi>Titus</hi> was in <hi>Crete,</hi> appointed by Saint <hi>Paul, to ordain Elders in every City, and to ſet in order the things which were wanting,</hi> Tit. 1.5. and other expreſſions of his Governing or Epiſcopal power, are contained in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers expreſſions of that Epiſtle. But it muſt be a ſtrange ſtrength of imagination that can inable any man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that when <hi>Crete</hi> was a Country almoſt three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles in length, and ſo greatly peopled, that it was very anciently called <hi>Hecatompolis,</hi> as having a hundred great places or Cities within its Territories, and <hi>Titus was to ordain Elders in every City;</hi> yet all theſe ſhould make up but one particular Congregation, unto which the power of <hi>Titus</hi> ſhould be confined.</p>
                           <pb n="298" facs="tcp:170758:159"/>
                           <p n="7">7. And concerning the Authority of Councils, it is manifeſt, that upon occaſion of ſome <hi>Judaizing</hi> Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers diſturbing the Chriſtian Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Act. 15. met together and gave their authoritative deciſion concerning Circumciſion and other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites, not to be impoſed on the <hi>Gentile</hi> Chriſtians, any further than they particularly injoined. This may well be called a General Council, ſince it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounced a deciſive determination concerning the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Church, expreſſing what the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not to admit, or were obliged to practiſe, and on what terms the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound to admit, and not ſcruple Communion with the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but alſo had in it ſuch perſons, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Apoſtles, had an undoubted univerſal Authority over the whole Church. And whereas the deciſion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves alone, and their Authority had been of it ſelf abundantly ſufficient to lay an obligation upon the Chriſtian Church in that particular caſe, the Apoſtles not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, took in with them the Elders of the Church to debate, and conſider of this matter, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.6. which is a ſufficient evidence that the Apoſtles did allow ſuch Elders or Church-Officers, as they eſtabliſhed in the Church, to have a power in Councils, to order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what related to the affairs of the Church by Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical Authority: for otherwiſe the Apoſtles would never have joyned them with themſelves to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo forward and zealous to require a general obedience to the deciſion of this Council, that in his Miniſtry he delivered to the Cities where he preached, the decrees for to keep, <hi>which were ordained of the Apoſtles and Elders which were at Jeruſalem,</hi> Act. 16.4. And here that expreſſion of his, delivering theſe Decrees as not only ordained of the Apoſtles, but of the Apoſtles and Elders alſo, deſerves to be conſidered, as thereby laying a more clear and manifeſt foundation for the Authority of future Synods and Councils of the Officers and Biſhops of the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170758:159"/>Chriſtian Church. And it may be further obſerved, that caſe in which S. <hi>Paul</hi> rebuked S. <hi>Peter, Gal.</hi> 2. was his not acting according to the rules of this Council, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying further with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites, and the favourers of the Circumciſion, than was here determined; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to own that liberty of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Church which was contained in this Synodical deciſion.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. And conſonant hereunto, the ancient Chriſtian Churches did all along greatly reverence the authoritative deciſion of Catholick Councils and Synods, the Canons of which are ſo well known to all men of ordinary reading, that he muſt be a man greatly ignorant of Eccleſiaſtical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, who knows nothing of them. And in ſeveral Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Provincial Councils, and in thoſe Canons particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly taken into that ancient Code, called the Canons of the Apoſtles, or into the Codes of the Univerſal Church, of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church, or the <hi>African</hi> Church; many things were eſtabliſhed by them for the peace, unity and order of the Church, and eſpecially for the promoting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity therein; and the degrees of the puniſhment by ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, depoſition, excommunication, and the continuance thereof upon the offenders, are there plainly determined to be a Rule for the ſeveral Churches to act by. And in theſe ancient Councils, when there was great occaſion for ſuch heavy ſentences, the moſt eminent Officers, or the Biſhops of thoſe moſt renowned places in the Chriſtian Church, were depoſed, or excommunicated by their Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Authority, and not by their own particular Church. Thus was <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> depoſed by the Council at <hi>Antioch, Neſtorius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> by the General Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> by the General Council of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> to which multitudes of other inſtances may be given. And in particular Churches the great and eminent authority fixed in Biſhops, though the Canons allowed but one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in the greateſt City with its precincts, is ſufficient to ſhew that the particular Congregations in that City had
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170758:160"/>no ſuch Independency of power and Government. So that this branch of <hi>Independency</hi> oppoſeth the Apoſtolical order, and the conſtant practice and ſenſe of all primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches from the Apoſtles.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This notion of <hi>Independency,</hi> lays a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for perpetual confuſion and diviſion in the Church, and ſubverts the precepts for Chriſtian Unity. For according to this Principle, ſo far as concerns power and authority, any company of men may ſet up for themſelves apart, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Sects and diſtinct Communions: and none having any Superior Government over them, theſe parties and diviſions may be perpetuated and ſubdivided to the ſcandal and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſtianity, and no way left for any authority in the Chriſtian Church to check and redreſs them. So that this notion is perfectly fitted to ſerve the intereſt of Schiſm and diſcord, and to heighten and increaſe, but is as fully oppoſite to the Unity and honour of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For if we ſhould admit for the preſent the ſcanty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect notion of Schiſm, which Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
                              <note n="(p)" place="margin">Review of Sch. againſt Mr. <hi>Cawdr.</hi> c. 8, 9.</note> hath framed, that it is needleſs diviſions of judgement and diſcord in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregation, when departing from it is no Schiſm, if the guilty party ſhould ſo far unchriſtianly foment ſuch diſcords, as to deſerve the cenſure of that Church; and ſhall withal proceed ſo far, as openly to ſeparate and depart from it; they have by this means according to this notion, after a ſtrange and admirable manner, ſet themſelves free, and clear both from ſin and cenſure. For when they have thus openly ſeparated from their former Communion, they themſelves become a diſtinct particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thereby are under no Superior Eccleſiaſtical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, nor can they be authoritatively cenſured by any: and by this open ſeparation, they according to this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are become a particular diſtinct Church, and the Schiſm is healed; and by being parted into two diſtinct Societies, there remains no longer any ſuch diviſion as there was before in one Congregation, which is Schiſm; but by
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170758:160"/>going further aſunder, and ſeparating from one another, they are in a wonderful manner brought to Unity in two oppoſite Congregations. And thus by the late rare inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, which have been unknown to all former times, the rending things aſunder, and breaking them in pieces, are the new found methods to make them one. But ſuch a way of Unity, if it can pleaſe ſome ſingular fancies, will appear monſtrous to the generality of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. That theſe notions and practices are great promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of diſcord and diviſion, is not a bare ſpeculation, but hath been manifeſted by ſufficient experience. In <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> the ſeparate Communion of the Societies of Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> under <hi>Browniſm;</hi> and in <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> the like of thoſe of Mr. <hi>Bridge,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Simpſon,</hi> proceeded upon this principle. And this very principle of <hi>Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> helped many forward in this Kingdom in our late times of diſcord, to ſet up new parties of <hi>Anabaptiſts, Seekers,</hi> and other Sects, many of which were the off-ſets of fermented <hi>Independency,</hi> and its adulterine off-ſpring. And the ſad and lamentable relation of the <hi>Bermudas Iſlands,</hi> called the <hi>Summer Iſlands,</hi> is alſo very conſiderable, where after this <hi>Congregational way</hi> was there undertaken, the rejected part are ſaid to have neglected all care of Religion, and the gathered or ſeparated part, to have run on in dividing, till they in a manner loſt their Chriſtian Religion in <hi>Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm.</hi> And thus many have made a further improvement, than the aſſerters themſelves allowed, of the allowed liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for them who<note n="(q)" place="margin">Inſtit. o Chur. n. 28.</note> are in Church-fellowſhip, (as they call their way) to depart from the Communion of the Church where they have walked, to join themſelves with ſome other Church, where they may injoy the Ordinances in the purity of the ſame.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. Wherefore this notion of <hi>Independency</hi> would miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Chriſtian Society, and the Inſtitution of Chriſt, as if whilſt Unity was earneſtly injoyned therein, the ſtate of this Society ſhould be left without that Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170758:161"/>which is neceſſary to preſerve it. For under this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del the Church would be as far from an orderly and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtate; as an Army would be when every ſeveral Troop or Company were left wholly to themſelves, and their own pleaſure, allowing ſome reſpect to be had to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their own Captain and inferiour Officers, but not owning any Authority of any General, or higher Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than what is in their own Troop. Or it might be ſomewhat reſembled by the ſtate of ſuch an imaginary Kingdom, where every Village in the Country, and every Pariſh in a City, ſhould have ſuch a chief power within themſelves; that there ſhould be no appeal for juſtice to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny higher Court, nor any other power to puniſh them, but what is executed by themſelves. If ſuch things as theſe were put in practice, they would not only hinder the ſerviceableneſs and uſefulneſs of ſuch an Army or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, (if it could be allowed to call them ſo) but here would be alſo wanting the beauty and comelineſs of Unity and Order, and a door opened to frequent diſcords and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall conſider their gathering Churches (as they call them) out of thoſe who were Chriſtian mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of Chriſt, and entring them into their Societies, by a particular Covenant made to and with a private Congregation, and pretending this Covenant to be the main ground, and true way of the eſtabliſhment and Union of a Church. The value they ſet upon this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, may appear from the declaration of the Churches in <hi>New England,</hi> who ſay,<note n="(r)" place="margin">Apol. for Ch. Cov. p. 5.</note> 
                              <hi>Firſt, That this is that whereby a company of Chriſtians do become a Church: it is the Conſtitutive form of a Church. Secondly, This is that, by taking hold whereof a particular perſon becomes a member of a Church.</hi> And though they frequently ſpeak ſo fairly to ſuch Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches as do not admit this ſpecial Covenant with a ſingle Congregation only, as to declare their owning them to be true Churches; yet all this cannot well be reconciled
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:170758:161"/>with this principle. And therefore thoſe of this way in <hi>England,</hi> at their publick meeting, ſpeak more openly and more conſiſtently with their own notion, when they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Of Inſtit. of Churches, n. 23.</note> every Society aſſembling for the celebration of the Ordinances according to the appointment of Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any civil Precincts and Bounds, is not thereby conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Church—and therefore a Believer living with others in ſuch a precinct, may join himſelf with any Church for his edification. But ſince this in truth is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating members from that which really is a true part of the Chriſtian Church, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> truly declared that<note n="(t)" place="margin">Pref. to Jus div. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gim. Eccleſ.</note> 
                              <hi>gathering Churches out of Churches, hath no footſteps in Scripture, is contrary to Apoſtolical practice, is the ſcattering of Churches, the Daughter of Schiſm, the Mother of Confuſion, but the Step mother to Edification.</hi> But I muſt acknowledge, that the preſent practices of this party alſo, looks as if they had now laid aſide this opinion.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. But this <hi>Congregational</hi> method doth ſuppoſe, that Baptized Chriſtians are not obliged by any Church-relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they are already in, to Communicate with any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, or part of the Chriſtian Church: when the natural conſequence of the Unity of the Chriſtian Church, will be to lay an obligation upon all its members, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with that regular part thereof, within whoſe Precincts they reſide. And this new notion gives a larger diſcharge to multitudes of Chriſtians from the duties of Communion, than the rules of Religion will allow, until they ſhall enter into ſuch a particular Covenant, which is not only unneceſſary, but unwarrantable alſo, as will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after appear. And there ſeemed too much reaſon for that complaint of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> by the Provincial Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (as they ſtiled themſelves) that <hi>the removing the Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Bounds, would open a gap to thouſands of people, to live like Sheep without a Shepherd, and inſtead of joining with purer Churches, to join with no Churches, and in a little time (as we conceive,</hi> ſay they, adding in the Margent, <hi>as our experience abundantly ſhews) it would bring in all manner of profaneneſs
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170758:162"/>and Atheiſm.</hi> And whilſt they unwarrantably declare, the fixed ſtate of our Church to be ſuch, that Chriſtians are not obliged to hold Communion therewith, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both themſelves depart from it, and teach others to do the like; it deſerves to be more ſeriouſly conſidered by them, than hitherto it hath been, how this dividing, principle and practice can be juſtified before Chriſt himſelf. For if Chriſt will ſay to them who neglect to expreſs kindneſs and reſpect to the reſt of his members, <hi>In as much as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me,</hi> Matt. 25.45. May not they fear leſt they hear the ſame, who raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unjuſtly caſt contempt, reproach and diſreſpect, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Church which he owneth as his; and diſown, and reject its Communion?</p>
                           <p n="15">15. But this which they call gathering of Churches, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to themſelves thoſe who either were, or ought to have been under other Guides and Governours of the Church, in a different, but more juſtifiable way and order, is indeed a making diviſions in a ſetled Church, and ſeparations from it. And this practce of diviſion and ſeparation, is ſo greatly diſpleaſing to the Holy Spirit of God, that there are many earneſt and vehement expreſſions in the Holy Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. To which purpoſe the Apoſtle beſeecheth the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, to mark them who cauſe diviſions and offences contrary to the Doctrine they had received, and avoid them,</hi> Rom. 16.17. <hi>even them who by good words and fair ſpeeches, deceived the hearts of the ſimple.</hi> Againſt ſuch ſeparations the ancient and Primitive Chriſtians were very zealous (as I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in<note n="(u)" place="margin">Libert. Eccleſ. B. 1. C. 1. Sect. 3.</note> another place) and ſo are alſo the generality of the Proteſtant Writers.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. Such a way of ſeparation, which in the phraſe and language of the ancient Chriſtians, was expreſſed by a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> contemning his own Biſhop, and having a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Congregation, and erecting another Altar (or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Communion, as to Sacramental adminiſtrations) was ſeverely cenſured in thoſe early times of Chriſtianity. In that moſt ancient<note n="(x)" place="margin">Can. Ap. 31.</note> collection of Canons, ſuch a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,</hi>
                              <pb n="305" facs="tcp:170758:162"/>and as many of the Clergy as joined with him, were ſentenced to be depoſed, and the Laity to be Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated after admonition. The Code of Canons of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, further determine concerning a <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Deacon,</hi> who ſhall thus ſeparate,<note n="(y)" place="margin">Cod.

But becauſe this other opinion of theirs is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo erroneous, it is of greater concernment to obſerve, that this way of Covenanting, is oppoſite to the Inſtitution of Chriſt, in that by diviſion and ſeparation, it breaks the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Chriſtian Church, which Chriſt hath eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be one Church, and one Body. But the dividing the Church into ſeveral <hi>Independent</hi> Societies, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the Inſtitution of Chriſt appointeth, is ſo much deſigned by this Covenant, that ſome of themſelves tell us,<note n="(h)" place="margin">ibid. Anſw. to Qu. 8.</note> without this kind of Covenanting, we know not how it would be avoided, but all Churches would be confounded into one. Now this is as much as to ſay, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who appointed not this kind of Covenanting, eſtabliſhed the Chriſtian Church in that way of Unity, that it was one Church, but theſe have ordered this method for the dividing it.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This caſts a diſparagement on Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Baptiſm, as if this Ordinance of his was not ſufficient and effectual for the purpoſes to which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it, whereof one was the receiving Members into his Church, and the Communion thereof. The Scriptures declare Chriſtians to be <hi>Baptized into one Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.12. <hi>and that they who are Baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.27. and therefore by this Sacramental Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, members are received into fellowſhip with Chriſt, and communion with his Church.

                              <hi>they do not believe that Baptiſm doth make men mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:170758:164"/>of the Church;</hi> and they there ſay ſtrangely enough, that <hi>Chriſt Baptized, but made no new Church.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Chriſt appointed Baptiſm, to receive mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Church, this Covenant which he never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, is by them ſet up thus far in the place and room of it.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By making this Covenant, the only right ground of Church-fellowſhip, they caſt a high reflexion on the Apoſtolical and Primitive Churches, who neither pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed nor delivered any ſuch thing: as if the Apoſtolical Model muſt give place to theirs, and thoſe firſt Churches muſt not be eſteemed regularly eſtabliſhed. But this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant managed in the dividing way, is ſomewhat like the practice of <hi>Novatus,</hi> who hath been ever reputed guilty of great Schiſm; who ingaged his followers by the moſt ſolemn Vow, that they ſhould never forſake him, nor return to <hi>Cornelius</hi> their true Biſhop: only his Covenant had not a peculiar reſpect to a particular Congregation. But this bond of their own promiſe and vow, was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep them in that ſeparation, which the more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Vow of Baptiſm, and undertaking Chriſtianity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged them to reject. And it is a great miſtake to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the former ought to take place againſt the latter; or that men may bind themſelves to act againſt the will of God, and that thenceforth they ought not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The confinement of Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to a ſingle Congregation, entred under ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Covenant, is contrary to ſeveral plain duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. For according to this notion, the peculiar offices of Brotherly Love, as being members one of another, and that Chriſtian care that follows thereupon, it limited to a narrow compaſs (together with the exerciſe of the <hi>Paſtoral care</hi> alſo) which ought to be inlarged to all thoſe profeſſed
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:170758:164"/>Chriſtians, with whom we do converſe. And it is of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and pernicious conſequence, that the duties of love, and being helpful to one another, and provoking to love and good works, upon account of our memberſhip with the Church viſible, (though theſe things be in practice too much neglected) ſhould be ſtraitned by falſe and hurtful notions and opinions. It was none of the leaſt miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that when God gave them that great Commandment, <hi>to love their Neighbour as themſelves;</hi> they ſhould ſatisfie themſelves in the performing this duty with a much more reſtrained ſenſe of the word <hi>Neighbour,</hi> than the Divine Law intended. And it muſt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that falſe imaginations concerning the bounds of the Church, and fellowſhip therein, will be eſteemed in the ſight of God, a ſufficient diſcharge from the duties he requires men to perform to others: nor will this be a better excuſe under Chriſtianity, than the like miſtake was under <hi>Judaiſm.</hi>

                           <p n="23">23. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall conſider their placing the chief Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical power and authority in the Body of the people, or the members of the Church. To this purpoſe by ſome of them we are told, that<note n="(m)" place="margin">Anſw. to 32. Qu. to Q. 14.</note> 
                              <hi>in</hi> Peter <hi>and the reſt, the Keys are committed to all Believers, who ſhall join together in the ſame confeſſion, according to the Ordinance of Chriſt;</hi> and they give the people the power of<note n="(n)" place="margin">Anſw. to Qu. 15.</note> cenſuring of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, even Miniſters themſelves if they be ſuch. And on this account, at leaſt in part, I ſuppoſe the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Churches in their Declaration of Faith, omitted the whole Chapter of<note n="(o)" place="margin">Ch. 30.</note> Church cenſures contained in the Aſſembly's Confeſſion, in which they had declared the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven to be committed to the Church Officers. Now beſides that the way of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Cenſure by the major Vote of the people, hath been the occaſion of much confuſion in ſome of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; that which I ſhall particularly inſiſt on, is the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:170758:165"/>great ſin of intruding upon any part of the Miniſterial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or neglecting due regard or reverence thereto. How plain is it in the Scripture, that the Apoſtles govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ordered the ſtate of the Chriſtian Church, and that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and the Angels of the Churches did, and were to do the like. It was to the Apoſtles as chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Chriſtian Church, that Chriſt declared, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.23. <hi>whoſeſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted, and whoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſins ye retain, they are retained;</hi> and <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.18. <hi>whatſoever yet ſhall bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe in Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi> And by theſe, and ſuch like words, the power of inflicting Cenſures; and receiving to, and conferring of the priviledges of the Church; as well as of diſpenſing all thoſe Ordinances whereby the grace of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins are particularly tendered, are appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Officers of the Church as part of their Office.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. In this plain ſenſe were theſe Chriſtian Laws ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally underſtood by the Primitive Church, which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed accordingly, which they who read the ancient Canons muſt neceſſarily confeſs. And the ſame is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt from the particular Writers of the firſt Ages. For inſtance, even<note n="(p)" place="margin">Cyp. Ep. 27.</note> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> from what our Lord ſpake to S. <hi>Peter</hi> of the power of the Keys, and of binding and looſing, infers the <hi>Epiſcopal honour,</hi> and that every act of the Church, muſt be governed by thoſe Prefects or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors. And from thoſe words, and what our Saviour ſpake to his Apoſtles, <hi>Jo.</hi> 20. about remitting ſins, he concludes, that only the Governours in the Church<note n="(q)" place="margin">Ep. 73.</note>, can give remiſſion of ſins. And when <hi>Rogatianus</hi> a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop complained to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> concerning a Deacon who behaved himſelf contumeliouſly towards him, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> commends his humility in addreſſing himſelf to him,<note n="(r)" place="margin">Ep. 65.</note> when he had <hi>himſelf power</hi> by virtue of his <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and the authority of his Chair, to avenge himſelf of him, and might be certain that what he ſhould have done by

                              <hi>his ſacerdotal power,</hi> would be acceptable to all his <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues.</hi> In which words he plainly aſſerts the authority of inflicting an Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure even upon a Deacon to be wholly in the Biſhops power by virtue of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And it is indeed no mean authority, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Inſtitution of our Lord, to the Officers of the Chriſtian Church, who are appointed to be as Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p n="25">25. Indeed they of the <hi>Congregational way</hi> do aſſert ſome ſpecial authority to the Paſtors and Teachers of their Congregations; and to them they particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the adminiſtration of the Sacraments.

But then they alſo place the power of making theſe Officers, and committing authority to them, in the people, and attribute very little to the power of Ordination. Indeed concerning a Paſtor, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher or Elder, they tell us, that<note n="(t)" place="margin">Ibid. n. 11.</note> it is appointed by Chriſt, (but no ſuch appointment can be produced) he be choſen by the <hi>common ſuffrage of the Church it ſelf, and ſolemnly ſet apart by faſting and prayer, with impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands of the Elderſhip of that Church, if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny before conſtituted therein.</hi> But if there be no Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in that Congregation (as there can be none in the firſt erecting any particular Congregational Church, and in the after appointing a Paſtor, it muſt be at leaſt of thoſe who are in inferiour Office)<note n="(u)" place="margin">Anſw. to Qu. 13.</note> they think it <hi>neither law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nor convenient,</hi> to call in the aſſiſtance of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of other Churches, by <hi>way of authority,</hi> when the Church is to ordain Officers. But this Poſition proceeds upon their dividing notion, in not owning the true U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Catholick viſible Church, and thereupon they aſſert, that as to<note n="(x)" place="margin">Anſw. of Eld in New Engl. to 9. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. Poſ. the 8.</note> 
                              <hi>acts of authority and power in diſpenſing Gods Ordinance, a Miniſter cannot ſo perform a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:170758:166"/>Miniſterial act to any other Church but his own.</hi> But how little they eſteem that irregular way of impoſing hands, which themſelves ſpeak of as Chriſts Inſtitution, may appear from their declaring that a Paſtor, Teacher, or Elder choſen by the Church,<note n="(y)" place="margin">Inſt. of Ch. n. 12.</note> though not ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by impoſition of hands, are rightly conſtituted Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Jeſus Chriſt.

But ſurely thoſe who let looſe their fancies at ſuch a ſtrange rate, uſed no great conſideration of what they wrote.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. And it greatly concerns the people, ſince they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to act in the name of Chriſt, in diſpenſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the power of the Keys, as in inflicting Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual cenſures; and to exerciſe his authority in conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting Officers in his Church, by giving Office-power to them; that they be well aſſured, that they have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient authority from him to warrant their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: eſpecially ſince ſuch things as theſe are repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Holy Scripture, and have been ever eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Ancient Church, as well as the Modern, to be peculiar acts of the Miniſterial power in the Chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Church. And they whom they call Paſtors, or Teachers, but have no better authority than this to warrant them to be ſo, had alſo need to beware, how they undertake to diſpenſe the Chriſtian Myſteries, as Officers appointed in Chriſts name. For if they to whom God hath given no ſuch Commiſſion, preſume to ſet apart Officers in his name, and to impart to them his authority, this is like the act of <hi>Micah</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating <hi>Prieſts,</hi> Judg. 17.5, 12. or like <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious intruſion, in making thoſe to be Prieſts, who
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:170758:166"/>were not ſo according to the rules of Gods appointment, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.31. <hi>chap.</hi> 13.33. which thing with its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants, was ſo highly offenſive to God, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next words tell us, <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. <hi>this thing became a ſin unto the houſe of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it from off the face of the earth.</hi> Nor can it be thought a leſſer affront to the Majeſty of God, to ſet up chief Officers in his name, without his Commiſſion; than it would be againſt the Majeſty of a King, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Judicatures in his Kingdom, or to confer the great Offices of the Realm, and places of eminent Dignity and Truſt, without any Authority from him, or from his Laws.</p>
                           <p n="27">27. And to exerciſe any proper Miniſterial power in the name of God or Chriſt, without ſufficient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is no ſmall offence. The ſevere puniſhment of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Sacrificing, by the loſs of his Kingdom, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.13, 14. and of <hi>

The dreadful Judgment upon <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company, for offering Incenſe, and pleading the right of all the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> as if they had taken too much upon them, was very remarkable. And much more is it ſinful and dangerous to intrench upon the Office of the Goſpel Miniſtry: becauſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt, the authority conveyed by him, and the grace conferred from him, are things more high and ſacred, than what was delivered by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="28">28. But the making and Ordaining Miniſters in the Church, was both in the Scripture, and in all ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of antiquity, performed by thoſe who had the chief authority of Office in or over the Chriſtian Church; as particularly by Chriſt himſelf, his Apoſtles, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170758:167"/>Biſhops. Chriſt himſelf ſent his Apoſtles as his Father ſent him; and he, not his other Diſciples, gave them their Commiſſion. S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> where they came, <hi>ordained Elders in every Church,</hi> Act. 14.23. and ſo muſt <hi>Titus</hi> do in every City of <hi>Crete,</hi> Tit. 1.5.

                              <hi>Novatus,</hi> (though very ill managed againſt peace, honeſty, and other rules of common morality, as <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> relates it) to ſend about to find three obſcure Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, who might Ordain him in oppoſition to <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi> But this is more fully evident from the great conteſts concerning the validity of <hi>Cecilians</hi> Ordination, againſt which the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> earneſtly objected, as the main pretence for their Schiſm, that <hi>Felix</hi> one of the Ordainers of <hi>Cecilian</hi> was not a regular Biſhop, and therefore his Ordination was inſufficient, which caſe was canvaſed in <hi>Africa, Italy, France,</hi> and other places. So that that firſt Canon of the old Code,<note n="(e)" place="margin">Can. Ap. 1.</note> that a Biſhop was to be Ordained by two or three Biſhops, was ſo far manifeſtly agreeable to the ancient practice and ſenſe of the Church, that they uſually inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:170758:167"/>having the greater number of three in this Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

And this may be ſufficient to ſatisfie any man, that Ordination, and regular Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the chief Officer in the Church, was, in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, accounted greatly neceſſary; and that the Biſhops of other Churches (there being but one Catholick Biſhop of one Church) three at leaſt muſt meet together to confer this Ordination. Much more might be added, if it were needful in ſo plain a caſe.</p>
                           <p n="30">30. And whereas ſo great a ſtreſs is laid upon the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people, as if this were the great eſſential thing, which conſtituted any one in the Office of the Miniſtry; it is alſo manifeſt, that the choice of any perſon for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry which was by way of recommendation of him to thoſe who were to Ordain him, was ſometimes done by the people, and ſometimes by others. But there was no rule in the Scripture which requireth any neceſſity of the peoples election, nor was there ever any conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice hereof, either in the time of the Holy Scriptures themſelves, or in the next ages of the Primitive Church. When Chriſt choſe his Apoſtles, he <hi>called to him his Diſciples,</hi> and of them <hi>he choſe twelve, whom he named Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> Luk 6.13. but he did not appoint his other Diſciples to chuſe them. <hi>James</hi> who was made the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is related to have been choſen by the Apoſtles,<note n="(h)" place="margin">Euſ.

Thus <hi>Timothy</hi> was choſen by Prophecy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 14. And the Spirit directed the other Prophets and Teachers, that they ſhould <hi>ſeparate Saul and Barnabas for the work to which he had called them,</hi> Act. 13.2.

And that the Spirit of God ſhould then guide the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers to chooſe perſons for the Miniſtry, rather than the other Believers and Diſciples, may be of uſe to acquaint men, that our Saviour never made the peoples choice ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary, or the main thing eſſential to the Miniſtry.

                  <head>The firſt Diſcourſe examined, ſhewing what properties belong to the Rule of Faith.</head>
                  <p>THis Author <hi>J. S.</hi> intending, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as his Title page tells us, Rational Diſcourſes on the Rule of Faith; which I deſign to examine, ſpends his firſt Diſcourſe in ſeeking and laying down properties of that Rule. This was indeed requiſite to be inquired into; and had it been faithfully managed, as it is not, I had then paſſed by this Diſcourſe without any Animadverſion. But ſince it is neither accurate nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, ſome defects, and miſcarriages in it, are neceſſary to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>In this Diſcourſe he examines the ſenſe of theſe words, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LE, which</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>ſignifies a thing able to regulate or guide him who uſeth it,</hi> §. 2. <hi>and FAITH, which is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving God in revealed Truths,</hi> §. 8. <hi>which imports ſome knowledge of ſupernatural things. He conſiders that Faith or the knowledge of God, the vulgar may both have, ſince they may be ſaved,</hi> §. 8, 9, 10. <hi>and they may have doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it,</hi> §. 11. <hi>and ſince this Faith is a rational aſſent,</hi> §. 12. <hi>which they who are out of the Church ſhould imbrace,</hi> §. 13. <hi>and eminent Wits may be ſatisfied in,</hi> §. 14. <hi>and the moſt skill'd Adverſaries cannot ſhew its Rule poſſibly falſe,</hi> §. 15. <hi>and this Rule muſt aſſure us what Chriſt ſaid,</hi> §. 16. From this he gathers ſeven Properties of the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> §. 17. 1. <hi>It muſt be plain and ſelf-evident, as to its exiſtence unto all.</hi> 2. <hi>Evidenceable as to its Ruling Power to Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, even the rude Vulgar.</hi> 3. <hi>Apt to ſettle and juſtifie undoubting perſons.</hi> 4. <hi>To ſatisfie fully the Sceptical Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and rational Doubters.</hi> 5. <hi>To convince the moſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:170758:171"/>and acute Adverſaries. <hi>6.</hi> Built upon unmoveable grounds; that is, abſolutely certain in it ſelf. <hi>7.</hi> And abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcertainable unto us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having given ſome account of his Diſcourſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I come now to examine, whether he hath laid a ſufficient founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to raiſe from thence the properties of the Rule of Faith; and then whether the properties mentioned, be rightly raiſed, and do agree to the Rule of Faith? The ground he lays from the words <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſure and ſtable: for ſince theſe words, <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> even as he treats of them, do admit of ſome ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity in their ſenſe; it had been neceſſary to have firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, what was here intended to be ſignified by them. For beſides that the phraſe of <hi>regula fidei,</hi> or the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> is by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and other Ancients, ſometimes made uſe of for a kind of Creed, or compriſal of the chief Articles of Chriſtian Faith: I ſay beſides this, the word <hi>Rule,</hi> being here a Metaphor, the true meaning of it in this place, muſt be ſearched into. Nor doth he ſufficiently deſcribe his Rule by ſaying, it is able to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or guide him who uſeth it: for ſtill by a <hi>Rule</hi> may be underſtood, either that which is able to guide him who uſeth it, that by it ſomething to be inquired after, may be diſcovered knowably; or elſe a <hi>Rule</hi> is that from which all things about which ſuch a Rule may be made uſe of, may receive the moſt exact, perfect, and compleat way of trial and diſcovery. Now that is not the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> by which a man may be guided to believe ſome Divine reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truths, or moſt truths, which yet may either miſguide in ſome others, or not moſt exactly guide to the knowledge of them: but it is that by which all Divine revealed truths are ſufficiently diſcovered, by which there may be had the beſt determination of all Queſtions about ſuch truths which are neceſſary to be decided; and which is the moſt ſure and firm ground of believing every Divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed truth.</p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:170758:171"/>
                  <p>The want of conſidering and obſerving this, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> hath caſt this Author upon a threefold miſcarriage. <hi>Firſt,</hi> He hath omitted the moſt principal and neceſſary property of the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> which is, that it is the way to know, try and determine all matters of Faith, or revealed Truth; and that it is ſufficient to do all this, ſo far as it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite it ſhould be done. For if this property be omitted, all thoſe laid down by this Diſcourſer, will not have light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to diſcover which is the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> certainly and infallibly. For inſtance, this ſentence, <hi>God Created the Heavens and the Earth,</hi> or any other ſuch like, ſo delivered to us, that it appears certainly to come from God, though it cannot be called a <hi>Rule of Chriſtian Faith,</hi> becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains not ſo much Divine truth as is neceſſary either for every mans Salvation, or for the determining Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in Religion, ſo far as it is requiſite they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided; and this is received as much amongſt the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Jews,</hi> as amongſt Chriſtians: yet all the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties mentioned by this Diſcourſer, may be applied unto it, as much as to the Rule of Faith. 1. It may be to all ſelf-evident as to its exiſtence, That there is ſuch a truth deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2. It may be knowable, to have a ruling power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Vulgar. 3. It may ſettle them, who undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly receive it. 4. It may ſatisfie either Diſſenters, or Doubters. 5. It may convince Adverſaries. 6. It may be certain in it ſelf, and, 7. Aſcertainable to us.</p>
                  <p>A Second miſcarriage hence ariſing, is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> That in this Treatiſe he uſeth the phraſe of the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> in a very uncertain, fallacious and ambiguous ſenſe; ſometimes to ſignifie one thing, and ſometimes another. For under <hi>Faith,</hi> as he treats of it, he ſometimes includes all Divine revealed truth, ſo far as to a general ending of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies about them. So <hi>Praef.</hi> §. 7. he ſaith, <hi>Controverſie, or the skill to know what is Faith—if a Science muſt be grounded on ſome ſelf-evident Principle;</hi> and ſoon after he tells us, <hi>he hath indeavoured to ſhew the firſt Principle Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:170758:172"/>proceed on ſelf-evident;</hi> and this he calls <hi>the firſt principle in controverſie.</hi> Where it is plain he includes under <hi>Faith,</hi> all Divine revealed truths, concerning which there are any Controverſies raiſed. But in <hi>Diſc.</hi> 1. §. 8. where he lays as a ground, that the Vulgar are to be ſaved, that is, are to have Faith or the knowledge of God, he cannot mean, that they muſt be ſurely and rationally determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (as he grants Faith muſt be ſuch an aſſent) in all points of Faith, about which there is any Controverſie: for it is plainly evident, that even amongſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts the Learned men have not been determined in all points, <hi>de Fide,</hi> by the help of their Tradition. So by the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> he ſometimes means an only way to come to Faith, as <hi>Diſc.</hi> 2. §. 9, 10. he ſaith, <hi>Faith is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be had without the Rule of Faith;</hi> other times he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands by it only a ſufficient way to come to Faith, as <hi>Diſc.</hi> 1. §. 8, 9. he calls it, <hi>the means to arrive at Faith, or come to Faith.</hi> Sometimes he calls it, <hi>the ordinary way to Faith;</hi> ſo <hi>Corol.</hi> 1. and yet thence concludes, none can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have <hi>Faith,</hi> who hold not to the true <hi>Rule;</hi> and yet as having his heart miſgiving him in this confidence, he ſaith, <hi>Diſc.</hi> 1. §. 11. <hi>The Rule of Faith is the beſt, if not the only means to come to the knowledge of Faith.</hi> Now to treat of <hi>the Rule of Faith</hi> in ſuch a manner, as not to keep to one ſenſe, but ſome time by his Rule, to mean an only way, ſometimes a ſufficient way, ſometimes an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, other times the beſt, if not the only way; and by <hi>Faith,</hi> of which it is the <hi>Rule,</hi> ſometimes to underſtand ſuch Faith as is in all the believing Vulgar, and at other times under <hi>Faith,</hi> to take in all Controverſie about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters revealed of God: this is a ſtrange jumbling of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things together, and as it diſcovers much want of accurateneſs and rational proceeding in the Author, ſo it occaſions incoherency and confuſion in this his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:170758:172"/>
                  <p>A Third miſcarriage hence ariſing is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> That he build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth part of his diſcourſes upon a ſuppoſition which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly falſe, to wit, that all that Faith which is in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or in any others, is immediately produced by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> ſo <hi>Diſc.</hi> 1. §. 8, 9. whence §. 14. he calls the <hi>Rule of Faith, the immediate producer and cauſe of the aſſent of Faith;</hi> both with reference to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſort, and to the Learned. Now though the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> be the ſureſt way to beget Faith, or to try any point of Faith, yet is not all Faith in all perſons immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by it, but many times by other means. Thus the Diſcourſes of <hi>Origen, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and their Writings, have doubtleſs perſwaded and prevailed with many to receive the Chriſtian Faith by them, and believe many things declared in it: yet neither their words, nor writings, were any <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> ſince both in ſome things appear erroneous. The <hi>Goths</hi> were brought in to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity by the preaching of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and by that means believed many Chriſtian truths: and of later years, many <hi>Pagans</hi> have believed the Chriſtian Doctrine, ſome by the preaching of Proteſtants, and others by the Papiſts; yet cannot all theſe ways of delivery be called the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> nor indeed any of them. Yea it is ſenſibly evident, that many Chriſtian truths are received and believed both among Proteſtants and Papiſts by the Vulgar, either from the teaching of a Parent, or from a private Doctor or Teacher, which may be ſubject to ſome error, and ſo are not the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> ſince they may miſguide: and yet in many things of revealed truth, this is the common caſe of the Vulgar, before they come to underſtand the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> or that which they own as ſuch; even before the Proteſtant comes to underſtand the Scripture, and what is in it contained; and before the Papiſt underſtands the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church, and how he may know what is as ſuch delivered; ſince all that is taught or written by ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons cannot be as ſuch received.</p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:170758:173"/>
                  <p>I come now to examine the particular properties of the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> above recited. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The firſt property is, That it muſt be ſelf evident as to its exiſtence to all. His ground for this is, that the rudeſt Vulgar who are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Faith, are uncapable of any skill by ſpeculation,</hi> §. 3, 4, 9, 10. But <hi>Firſt,</hi> This proves not that it muſt be ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; by which he means, as appears in the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that that which is the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> appeareth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently to be ſuch, barely by conſidering this Rule in it ſelf, without any other helps and advantages: ſince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this way of ſelf-evidence, it may be ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceable to all capacities, in ſuch a manner as the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar are capable of knowing it. The Statutes of <hi>England,</hi> are a Rule for the deciſion of Caſes in the Law, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matters contained in them; but that they are ſo, cannot appear ſatisfactorily in all theſe Laws, by the bare reading of them: but their being ſufficiently and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly atteſted, and acknowledged to be enacted by the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Power, and unrepealed, evidenceth them to be ſuch. The Vulgar know that the laſt Will and Teſtament of a man, is as a Rule, to ſhew who hath title to the Goods of the deceaſed; and they are capable of knowing which is the laſt Will and Teſtament of a perſon, otherwiſe than from the bare reading of it; to wit, by the full witneſs and evident teſtimony of credible perſons concerning it. The ordinary <hi>Jews</hi> were capable of knowing the <hi>ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be given them from God, to guide them, otherwiſe than by the reading of them; to wit, by delivery of them as ſuch, by the conſtant teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of all the <hi>Jews,</hi> in that and the ſucceeding Ages. Whence it may appear to be ſelf-evident, that the Vulgar are capable of receiving other proof than ſelf-evidence, though not by deep ſpeculation, yet by teſtimonial evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Nor 2. Will it hence follow from his proof, that the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> ſhould be evident to all as to its exiſtence. By <hi>all</hi> he cannot here include them, who have
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:170758:173"/>no knowledge of Goſpel Revelation: But I ſuppoſe he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends all who have faith, or are in the way to attain it. But in this latitude, it is no property of the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> to be actually evident to all theſe; ſince there may be ſome Faith which is not immediately grounded upon the Rule, as was before ſhewed. Howbeit ſince the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> is intended to confirm and determine matters of faith, ſo that they may be received with a full and firm aſſent, and is thence of great uſe to all, to ſettle and ſtabliſh them in the faith; I aſſert, that the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> is evidenceable unto all, or may be made evident unto all who have capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of reaſon, both that it is, and that it is a Rule, if they be willing to receive that evidence which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond property, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> That it is evidenceable as to its ruling power, to Enquirers, even the rude Vulgar, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; ſuppoſing them willing to be ſatisfied with good evidence.</p>
                  <p>The third property I admit, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> That it is apt to ſettle and juſtifie undoubting perſons, that is, that they who rely on it without doubting, may be ſatisfied, that they act rationally.</p>
                  <p>The fourth property is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> That it is able to ſatisfie the moſt Sceptical Diſſenters, and rational Doubters. Had he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared only to mean by Sceptical, the moſt curiouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive, I would readily have granted this property: but it is ſuſpicious, that he includes ſuch Scepticks, as deſign to reject evidence; becauſe when he applies this Rule, <hi>Diſc.</hi> 3. §. 3. he ſpeaks of his Sceptick, <hi>as one who would find ſomewhat to reply rationally, or at leaſt would maintain his ſuſpence, with a, Might it not be otherwiſe?</hi> If he indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes perſons who ſet themſelves to reject evidence; I anſwer, the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> needeth not be able to ſatisfie them, nor can it; ſince they are not capable of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ſuch were many of the Heathen Philoſophers, of the Hereticks among Chriſtians, and probably of the Scribes and Phariſees. All he ſaid for the proof of this
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:170758:174"/>property was, <hi>That thoſe who are out of the Church, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Chriſt to be brought in to embrace the faith, and perſons of higheſt reaſon and enquiry in the Church may be ſatisfied concerning the faith,</hi> §. 13, 14. This is true of them who will embrace light and evidence where they find it, but not of them who reject it; and Proteſtants will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> (taking in the teſtimonial evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which is given concerning that Rule) is able to ſatisfie all Diſſenters or Doubters, who are ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive rational ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The fifth property is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> That it muſt be able to convince the moſt obſtinate and acute Adverſaries. This he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth proved from §. 15. <hi>Becauſe ſuch Adverſaries the Church will have, and the higheſt advantage they can have againſt the Church, is, to ſhew her Rule uncertain.</hi> But this only proves, that enough may be ſaid for the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it againſt all ſuch Adverſaries, which is indeed true; yea, and more than this, that enough may be ſaid to convince them, if they will attend to it, and be not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate; and however to ſatisfie all unprejudiced men, that theſe obſtinate Adverſaries are in error, and may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed. But more than this, is no way neceſſary to provide for the conviction of the obſtinate. If <hi>Porphyry, Celſus,</hi> or <hi>Julian</hi> were not convinced; ſhall any conclude, that God was wanting in the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> to his Church? But indeed the ſatisfaction of ſuch Heathen Adverſaries muſt be procured, not only from the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> which will ſhew what was delivered by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the Apoſtles, and Prophets, but alſo from other arguments and teſtimonial evidence, not only to prove, that this Rule was delivered by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but alſo to ſhew the things ſo delivered, to be of God, and therefore true.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth and ſeventh properties, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> That it is certain in it ſelf, and aſcertainable to us, I do admit. And indeed theſe two properties (if by <hi>aſcertainable to us,</hi> we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that we may be ſufficiently certain concerning the Rule, and what is contained in it) include all the former,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:170758:174"/>ſo far as they are truly applicable to the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> For to be certain and aſcertainable to us, includes ſo much of his two firſt properties, as belong to this <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> that is, it is evidenceable to all, both as to its being and its ruling power; ſeeing to be evidenceable, and to be aſcertainable, is one and the ſame thing. Yea, if it be certain, and it's certainly thus aſcertainable or evidence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to us, his third, fourth and fifth Properties will be the conſequent effects hereof, ſo far as they of right appertain to this <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> that is, where there appears cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty aſcertainable, it will have theſe effects; it will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie them who moſt ſtedfaſtly and undoubtingly rely on it, and will ſatisfie inquiſitive Diſſenters and rational Doubters, and will be able to convince the moſt acute Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries: Whence it appears, that his ſeven Properties are needleſly and without ſufficient diſtinction multiplied, and all the reſt are well reducible to the two laſt: to which, if we add what I before obſerved concerning this Rule, that it muſt be the beſt Guide in all matters of faith, we have then three Properties, which alone are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to direct us to the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> to wit, its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, its evidenceableneſs; and its fulneſs, exactneſs and compleatneſs as to all points of faith. But ſince his Diſcourſe I now examine, is ordered according to his ſeven Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſaving that he himſelf <hi>Diſc.</hi> 2. confounds, or at leaſt conjoyns the two former, it is neceſſary for me to follow him in his own way, and to examine the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> by what we have found to belong to it in all theſe Properties.</p>

                  <p>OUR next work is to examine by theſe marks, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> what the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> is. He tells us, §. 1. <hi>That the owned pretenders to it, are only two, Scripture and Tradition;</hi> but withal inſinuates, <hi>That Proteſtants do indeed make private Spirit, private Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Teſtimonies of Fathers the</hi> Rule of Faith; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are they which do aſcertain them of Scripture ſenſe.</hi> Now, we Proteſtants do own Scripture as our <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> which was ſurely delivered to us, by ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles; and do aſſert, that what ever Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do belong to the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> are truly and fully applicable to the Scripture: but unwritten Tradition we reject from being this Rule, knowing that there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and infallible delivery of Chriſtian Doctrine thereby. Nor do we any way make either private Reaſon or a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Spirit (whether he mean an Enthuſiaſtick Spirit, which Proteſtants diſclaim, or the ſame thing with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Reaſon) or Teſtimonies of Fathers our <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> For if Proteſtants ſhould try any Doctrine by any of theſe immediately, without referring them to Scripture, they would, as to that Doctrine, make them their Rule: but this no Proteſtant will do in matters of meer belief, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Revelation. But if they make uſe of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to apprehend the words, phraſes and ſenſe of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that thereby they may more fitly judge, what the Scripture will determine as to any matter of faith, this is no more to make this a Rule, than an Artiſt who meaſures any Materials by an exact known Rule, can be ſaid to make his eye his Rule, becauſe he judges by his eye, how
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:170758:175"/>his Rule is applyed to the thing meaſured: but in caſe he ſhall make uſe only of his eye, without any other Rule, then only can his eye be called his Rule. Indeed the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Tradition and all rational men, may as well be charged with making private reaſon their Rule, as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Scripture: ſince by reaſon they are aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of Traditions ſenſe: for they make uſe of reaſon to judge what the words ſignifie which are delivered to them, and what ground they have to receive them; elſe could not their aſſent of Faith be, as this Author acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it muſt be, rational, <hi>Diſc.</hi> 1. §. 14. unleſs he can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, a man to give a rational aſſent, which is not directed by reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Nor can we be ſaid to make the Teſtimonies of Fathers our Rule, though in plain truths we value them, owning the ſame truth which we embrace, as delivered by the Rule. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In ſome more difficult Scriptures, we make uſe of them to ſatisfie our reaſon, by their reaſon and evidence: and this is to uſe them in the ſame manner we uſe our reaſon. In other places difficult, we make uſe of their authority, as a probable motive to perſwade us to encline to a ſenſe by them delivered, if it be not contradicted by greater authority or reaſon. But in this caſe, where there is no other evidence, we do not urge ſuch an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſuch a ſenſe of ſuch a Scripture, neceſſary to be received as a Point of Faith, but allow it in ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure probable and to be aſſented to, as the Authorities ſhall require.</p>

That is, the words of Scripture which are written by inſpiration
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:170758:176"/>from God, do in the ſame manner declare Gods meaning in what he reveals, which is the Doctrine of Faith; as words written and ſpoken by men, declare their ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to one another; and thus we own them to be the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>

                     <hi>Ad</hi> §. 3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> To the firſt Objection I anſwer, That it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evidenceable even to the Vulgar, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are the Word of God. Now though the ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this or what may be gathered by inſpection into the Book of Scripture, is very conſiderable, <hi>as to the truths contained in Scripture;</hi> by obſerving that it contains power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and heavenly Doctrines, ſuitable to God, and great Prophecies wonderfully fulfilled: yet <hi>as to the writing which contains theſe truths,</hi> we have another more plain way, and generally evidenceable to all perſons, to aſſure them, that
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:170758:176"/>theſe Books are Gods Word: which is, that by the general delivery or tradition of the Church of Chriſt, or of all who appear to have the chief care of their own ſouls, theſe Books have in all Ages ſince Chriſt, and almoſt in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys been preſerved, as the Writings of the Prophets, Apoſtles and Evangeliſts; they have conſtantly and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly read them as ſuch, and given them to us, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that Doctrine which was ſo wonderfully confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Miracles. In this manner we receive all the Books of Holy Scripture as Gods Word; and by this way we have a plain, and withal a very full certainty; or by this means in S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s words <hi>De Civ. Dei, lib.</hi> 15. <hi>c.</hi> 23. <hi>The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the true Scriptures comes to us from the Fathers, by a moſt certain and known ſucceſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Compare the certainty of it, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> with any Hiſtorical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in the World, or with any other matters of fact in any former Age, and the certainty of Scripture is much the greater; becauſe it is more generally delivered, and hath been more conſtantly read. Compare this again with any Records in the World, and the knowledge of any Charter of any Society: the Records of a Court, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of a Colledge, or the Charter of a Corporation, are ſurely known to be ſuch by the Officers of that Court, and the Members of that Corporation, and even by the Vulgar in a ſucceeding Age, becauſe they are in written Records delivered as ſuch to them; and every one taketh this to be a ſufficient certainty: eſpecially if he know, that all fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Members of ſuch Societies, or Officers of ſuch Courts, are under the obligation of an Oath, to preſerve ſuch Records or Charters entire: and upon this evidence they doubt not to believe, what this Record or Charter doth contain. And much more certain is the delivery of Scripture Records as the Word of God; ſince there are not only one, but great multitudes of Chriſtian Societies over the whole World, who all agree in this delivery: and all theſe Societies, by their Profeſſion, and the Chriſtian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, are under the higheſt obligations not to falſifie
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:170758:177"/>in any thing; and eſpecially, in the delivery of ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents which are of Divine Inſpiration. To all this add the great evidence we have from the Writings of the ancient Fathers, that they did religiouſly own and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour this Book, as the Word of God. Laſtly, Compare the certainty of this truth of the Word of God being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, with the certainty of Doctrine by unwritten Tradition, or rather with its uncertainty; wherein we muſt conſider, that this delivering to us the writing of the Holy Scriptures, is of the ſame nature with that, whereby Monuments, preſerved Records or Charters are delivered from one generation to another; which the common apprehenſions of men ſhew, to be a much ſurer way of delivery, than this Tradition by way of hear ſayes: ſince in every Corporation, which hath a Charter delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red down ſafely from their Predeceſſors, if the Members of it would be ſure what are the Priviledges that belong to it, they will not think it the ſafeſt way to enquire, what are the common Opinions of that Society, and rely on this, which is like the way of Oral Tradition: but they will conſult the Charter it ſelf, and ſo reſt ſatisfied in what is there contained in their ſure Records. And the vulgar Chriſtians will conclude the truth of Chriſtian Doctrine, or what God delivered, to be more fully in the Scripture, than in the words of other Chriſtians or Tradition, by the ſame way, but by much greater evidence, than that, by which men of all Societies, will conclude the truth of what concerns their Priviledges, or what Emperours or Kings have granted them, to be more fully contained in their Charters, than in common reports.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this Tradition which we honour, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> owned by us, a Rule of our Faith, but a rational evidence, or a help and ground of our knowledge of this truth, that the Scriptures are the Word of God, or the Writings divinely inſpired: For in matters of Faith, though a man is ſupported by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which will give an account why he owns ſuch a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to be from God; yet as to the matter or thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:170758:177"/>he doth not exerciſe his reaſon, to prove the truth of the thing by rational evidence, but ſubmits his reaſon to rely on the credibility of the Divine Teſtimony, and upon this Teſtimony, owns what is atteſted by it: but when we ſay, we own the Scriptures to be Gods Word, by the forementioned way of Tradition, we act our reaſon as to the thing received by us; and do own and acknowledge this as truth, from that rational evidence which Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion affords to our reaſon; and ſo do receive it as true in a way of rational knowledge, which by this Traditional evidence we prove truth. The things contained in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture we receive by faith, becauſe contained in a divinely inſpired Writing; and here we enquire not for rational evidence, to prove them true. Here then we can be no more ſaid to build our faith on the Rule of Tradition, than publick Juſtice can be ſaid to be adminiſtred by the Rule of Tradition, when Caſes are decided by Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which have been ſucceſſively delivered from one Age to another.</p>
                  <p>But as he hath hitherto builded on a miſtake, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that we have no way to prove Scripture the Word of God, but only by conſidering the Letter of Scripture in it ſelf: ſo in the end of §. 3. he ſuppoſeth, that we muſt be able to ſatisfie all ſeeming contradictions in Scripture, before we can own it to be Gods Word. But cannot eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordinary Chriſtian both humbly and truly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that in things delivered by God, there may be many things above his underſtanding to comprehend, and above his apprehenſion to reconcile, which yet may be in themſelves both true and good? In this doing, we have the ſame ground to believe Scripture to be Gods Word; which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had in his forſaking <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> who makes this Confeſſion to God, <hi>Confeſ. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>Thou didſt perſwade me, that they were to be blamed, not who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved thy Books, which almoſt in all Nations thou haſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on ſo great authority, but who believed them not. Therefore when we were unable by evident reaſon to find out
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:170758:178"/>truth, and for this cauſe had need of the authority of the holy Scriptures, I now began to believe, that thou wouldſt by no means have given to that Scripture ſo excellent authority throughout all Lands, unleſs thou wouldſt that thou ſhouldſt be believed by it, and that thou ſhouldeſt be ſought by it. Now the abſurdities which uſed to offend me, I referred to the height of the Myſteries.</hi>

                     <hi>Ad</hi> §. 4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> To the ſecond Objection, concerning the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Books of holy Scripture, I ſhall firſt enquire, What ground the Vulgar have to own all the Books re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Proteſtants, and particularly by the Church of <hi>England</hi> as Canonical, to be the divinely inſpired Scriptures, or the Word of God? Now they may ſafely and with good ground receive all theſe Books, becauſe they are ſo owned by the ſame above-mentioned Tradition or delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all Churches, as they received them from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: nor was there ever in the Church any doubt of the Books we receive of the Old Teſtament, or of any of the Evangeliſts, or of the moſt of the Epiſtles. And though there was ſome doubt at ſome time, in ſome places, concerning ſome few Books; yet theſe doubts were never general: nor did they in any place continue, but were check'd by known conſent in the beginning of Chriſtianity; of which S. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaks <hi>ad Dardanum Ep.</hi> 129. <hi>We receive them following the authority of ancient Writers.</hi> Now that all theſe Books have been alwayes thus delivered by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church as the Word of God, the Vulgar hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon to acknowledge, ſince it hath the ſame cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty with the way of delivering ſo many preſerved Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, by the agreement of ſuch multitudes of Societies, which is a much more certain way than Oral Tradition of Chriſts Doctrine, as was ſhewed <hi>n.</hi> 6. This delivery of theſe Books, is commonly aſſerted by the preſent Age, and by men of greateſt knowledge amongſt the Proteſtants: nor at this time doth the <hi>Roman</hi> Church reject any of them. Though indeed S. <hi>Hierom</hi> tells us, <hi>That in his time the</hi> Latin <hi>Cuſtom did not receive the Epiſtle to the</hi> Hebrews
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:170758:178"/>
                     <hi>amongſt Canonical Scriptures,</hi> in his Commentaries upon <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. and elſewhere. Which <hi>Euſebius</hi> alſo takes notice of, <hi>Eccl. Hiſt. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 21. So that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was not then the moſt faithful preſerver of what was delivered in the Church Catholick, which did acknowledge this and the other Scriptures, by which they are ſufficiently delivered to us, and by which S. <hi>Hierom</hi> did receive even this Epiſtle, as he particularly writes in the above-mentioned Epiſtle <hi>ad Dardanum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now being ſecure of theſe Books, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> we are ſure that we have ſafe delivery of all neceſſary truth required to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for as it is obſervable, that concerning the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, no other Church, nor the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church, doth pretend to any other Book of Scripture in the New Teſtament: ſo S. <hi>Luke chap.</hi> 1. hath aſſured us, that in his Goſpel are written what things are neceſſary to be believed as the Chriſtian Faith. So that hitherto it appears, how common Chriſtians may know enough for their ſalvation: and yet further, they knowing all theſe Books to be of God, can thence conclude, that whatever is declared in them is true, and what ever is condemned there, is falſe or evil; and by this means they may attain much knowledge.</p>
                  <p>And though theſe vulgar Chriſtians may ſafely be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the Controverſie concerning the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Books, as is evident from what is above ſaid; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> and men of greater learning and knowledge, for whom the tryal of all Controverſies is a more proper work, are and may be fully certain concerning it, by their fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving what was the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in this point; yet the vulgar may poſſibly, be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſatisfied, that none of thoſe Books are part of the Scriptures divinely inſpired. For ſince they can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand from men of knowledge and learning, that none of thoſe Books were received in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, to whom the Oracles of God were committed: Nor were they any of them generally received as of divine inſpiration, and
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:170758:179"/>for proof of Doctrines, by the Catholick Chriſtian Church; they may thence conclude, that it is as ſafe for them not to own them as ſuch, as it was for the Catholick Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, whom neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles charged with any ſin and corruption in this particular. And likewiſe they may ſee, that they have as little reaſon to be guided by the particular <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, in oppoſition to the Church Catholick concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe Books, as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> had concerning the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> eſpecially ſince they of <hi>Rome</hi> have not fixedly kept and declared the ſame Books at all times for Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have a certainty of the Canon of Scripture, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> which Proteſtants own for their Rule: but this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſer cannot but know that concerning Traditions, which he makes his Rule; neither the vulgar Papiſts, nor yet the learned can certainly know in all points, how many and which are truly ſuch, which hath occaſioned great diſputes, and high conteſts amongſt them of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ad</hi> §. 5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> To the third Objection, concerning the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Originals, I anſwer, That it is not neceſſary for the vulgar, either to know or enquire concerning the Originals; it is enough for him to have evidence, that the Scriptures remain entire, though he know not what Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was their Original. But if it be enquired, how every one may know, that theſe Scriptures are preſerved entire, and how they who have any apprehenſions of the Original, may know, that it is incorrupt as to the faith it contains, he may thus be ſatisfied. When he conſiders, that it is Gods Word delivered to the World for their uſe, that they may know him and believe him, as we before ſhewed; this common Chriſtian may thence conclude, that if he does his beſt to enquire, God will preſerve his Word ſo free from corruption, that it ſhall not miſguide him to his hurt. And when he further knows, that the Church of God hath alwayes had the higheſt eſteem of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:170758:179"/>theſe Books of any others in the world, and the greateſt care of them, and that there are infinite Copies of them, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Regions of the World, both in Originals and Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which that they all contain in them an agreement in the ſame matters of truth, he hath good reaſon to believe, becauſe it is generally aſſerted by the beſt and moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men this vulgar Chriſtian knows; and even the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> who deſign to ſpeak all they can againſt the certainty of Scripture, have never yet dared to affirm the contrary: for though there be many various readings, yet not ſuch which will miſ-guide in any matter of Faith. Theſe things will make him more ſecure of the Scriptures being preſerved entire, than any man can be of the Statutes of the Land, or of any Hiſtories, or any other Records what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; that is, he hath the greateſt evidence of its inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, that can be of any Writing in the World, which had its original ſome Ages paſt, and infinitely a greater evidence than can be given for Oral Tradition being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. For if one Record be commonly acknowledged a more certain preſervative of truth, and in it ſelf leſs lyable to corruption, than common fame; much more when ſo numerous Records, or carefully and religiouſly tranſcribed Copies all agree. Again, when he conſidereth that in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church the Scriptures were, untill the coming of Chriſt, in very corrupt times, and amongſt very corrupt perſons, preſerved ſo entire, that Chriſt ſendeth to them to learn Religion; he hath great reaſon to judge the New Teſtament preſerved entire, ſince we cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Providence leſs careful of the New Teſtament than of the Old, and there are now abundantly more Copies, both Tranſlations and Originals (and old Tranſlations ſpeak the agreement of the old Originals whence they were tranſlated) and theſe Scriptures highly valued, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly read in a conſtant manner, in ſo many places of the World; and all agree in all points of Faith. Nor could they poſſibly be any where all corrupted to one purpoſe, in a way ſo apparent to ſenſe, as words written are, ſince
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:170758:180"/>there never was any General Council, collected out of all parts of the World, to determine any thing concerning the various Scripture readings, or the alteration of any Copies; if any ſuch had been, it is poſſible there might have been ſome corruption general, if not by confederacy, yet by miſtake, unleſs the former Copies ſhould yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to diſcover this, as it is certain many very ancient Copies, and probably more ancient than any General Council, yet remain in the World; as for inſtance, that written by <hi>Tecla,</hi> in our Kings Library, ſent from <hi>Cyrill</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>

S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerved <hi>de Doct. Chriſtiana, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>The holy Scriptures being ſpread abroad far and wide, by the various Tongues of the Interpreters, are made known to the Nations for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> And a man of mean capacity may be ſatisfied concerning Tranſlations, if he conſider that he hath reaſon to judge, that the Original Languages may be underſtood by men of learning, partly becauſe himſelf by uſe and obſerving, hath learnt his own Mother-Tongue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath reaſon to think, that others by the ſame means, may learn other Languages; and particularly thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Scriptures were written: partly becauſe he thinks it injurious to the Goodneſs &amp; Wiſdom of God, to imagine, that he ſhould give forth a writing to guide the World, and that it ſhould be in a Language which was not intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible; and partly becauſe he hears that ſo many Churches have theſe Books tranſlated, and that even ſuch as this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſer, who would caſt and ſuggeſt all doubts they can concerning Scripture tranſlated into the common Tongues, yet dare they not ſay, that it is not capable of being tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, ſo as to deliver the ſame matters of Faith: yea, the Papiſts themſelves both uſe, allow of, and many of them endeavour to make new Tranſlations. Having gone thus far, he may further conſider, that if it can be
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:170758:180"/>truly tranſlated, he hath reaſon to judge, that ſuch men who have the common fame, even amongſt the Learned, for men of skill in Languages, are beſt able to give the ſenſe of the words contained in thoſe Languages; and he can conclude, that whatever God thought requiſite for him to know from this Book, is ſo written, that ſuch men of Learning are able to give the ſenſe of it: and that whatever in any phraſe cannot by ſuch be underſtood, is ſomething fit to be further enquired into, but not neceſſary to be now known. Yea further, he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he hath reaſon to conceive, that the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with us in uſe, doth contain in it the true Doctrine of Chriſt, which is in the Original; becauſe he heareth this oft averred by honeſt and learned men amongſt us, and becauſe the Papiſts who are profeſſed enemies to this Tranſlation, yet dare not, nor do not aſſert the contrary; but raiſe only ſome more inconſiderable Cavils about phraſes. By this I ſuppoſe our vulgar Chriſtian ſatisfied: if this Diſcourſer be not with this anſwer, let him conſider a parallel caſe. If many <hi>Engliſh</hi> men ſhould purpoſely go to <hi>France</hi> to give a deſcription of that Countrey, and they take a particular view of all places, and write this, and all agree together, and many thouſand others who after go to ſee it, all agree in all material things; yea, and when many others ſhall go over on purpoſe to find fault with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, who yet can find nothing very material to object, but only carp at ſmall things; will this Author ſay, that all this can ſignifie nothing to inform him ſatisfactorily who ſtayes at home, unleſs he could be able to demonſtrate to himſelf, that they indeed were in <hi>France,</hi> as they all agree, and that they did ſee what they wrote. Either this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very conſiderable, and rational to engage aſſent; or elſe againſt all reaſon, moſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> men have confeſſed, that there is ſuch a place as <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſuch a perſon as is called the Pope, when we never ſaw either <hi>it</hi> or <hi>him.</hi>

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:170758:181"/>ſuſpicious in the whole Book, here is manifeſtly evident, either a piece of groſs ignorance in the Writer, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned cheat upon his Reader: for ſince he apparently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns his Book for <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, and all our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations now in ordinary uſe, had their original ſince our departing from Popery; and our generally received Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation is not above Fifty Three Years older than his Book, yet he would have the vulgar to imagine, that there might be many faults in tranſcribing theſe Tranſlations, in innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Copies before Printing, when Printing was long before theſe Tranſlations were firſt made. But to paſs this by, ordinary Proteſtants may be thus ſatisfied concerning the Printed Copies of the Scripture, by conſidering that there is as great care taken about Printing Bibles, as about copying Records, and more than about Printing any other Books: and yet this Author (who would perſwade other to doubt ſo much of the Printers keeping to the truth of the Copy before him, as to the ſenſe of it) I ſuppoſe would not have ſent his Book to the Preſs, if he had thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the ſenſe of it was not like to be expreſſed in Print: He may further conſider, that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles are daily read, publickly or privately, by learned men, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Originals, and found to agree with them, except in ſome particular errors of Print, which as they are not in many expreſſions, may be diſcerned by common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. And the ordinary Chriſtian hath the more cauſe to be confident, of our ordinary Impreſſions of the Bible, becauſe even the Papiſts, who are enemies to them, and do peruſe them, yet dare not charge them to vary from the firſt tranſlated Copies, more than is above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>

                     <hi>Ad</hi> §. 8. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> To the ſixth and laſt Objection, concerning the ſenſe of Scripture, I anſwer, The faith of the vulgar (no nor of the learned neither) doth not require a certain knowledge of the ſenſe of all Scripture. The diſcovery of God, what he is, and of Chriſt, and what he did and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us, and of the Goſpel Promiſes and Commands,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:170758:181"/>and ſuch like, are ſo plain, that he who can underſtand any thing of common ſpeech, may underſtand ſo much of them, as is neceſſary for him to know: yea, they are in Scripture oft delivered in the very words and phraſes, which Chriſt himſelf and the Apoſtles and Prophets made uſe of to their hearers, to inſtruct them in the faith and holy life: and therefore he who will cenſure the Scripture as not ſufficiently plain to teach the great truths of God, muſt condemn the Apoſtles likewiſe and Chriſt himſelf, as not teaching, ſo as to be underſtood; and then muſt impiouſly tell the World, that either none were by them brought to the faith, or that they who were, did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. Indeed he thinks ſtrangely of man, who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth that he muſt go to an Oracle, to underſtand ſuch things as theſe, That Chriſt came into the World to ſave ſinners, That he dyed for our ſins, and roſe again, and ſhall judge the World: If theſe and ſuch like plain words, which are abundantly in the holy Scriptures, cannot be underſtood by common capacities, I dare affirm, that they can never know theſe truths, by any words and phraſes, and ſo can never be helped by ſuch men as this Diſcourſer, who can ſhew no other ordinary way to teach the matters of meer belief, but by words, unleſs they will embrace Enthuſiaſm. Indeed many things in Scripture are hard to be underſtood: concerning which, this ordinary Chriſtian may ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that ſince God gave him this Book to lead him to God, it is evident from Gods end in writing it, that he hath expreſſed ſo much as is neceſſary for him to know, that it is not beyond his capacity to diſcern it, if he dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently attend to it: and what he is not capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he may be ignorant of, without fear of loſing ſalvation by ſuch ignorance; provided he be careful to uſe ſuch means as God affords him, and be willing to receive further inſtruction, as he ſhall be capable of further knowledge. And then this ordinary Chriſtian may by this means be of a ſound mind, and of a more knowing head in matters of Faith, than moſt Papiſts are, who know
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:170758:182"/>as little, or leſs of the things which are obſcure in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, than Proteſtants do; and by this means he may own Chriſts Divinity, as may appear, <hi>n.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>Having now ſhewed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> that in all his Arguments hitherto produced, againſt the Scriptures being the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> there is nothing rational; I ſhall now briefly ſhew, that the promoting ſuch Cavils as theſe, or being perſwaded by them, would be a way very much to hinder Piety, and even wholly to diſown Chriſtianity, which I ſhall do, in applying moſt or all his Arguments to ſome particular Caſes.</p>
                  <p>We read that <hi>Joſiah</hi> when the Book of the Law was found, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> did by that, in a Pious and Religious Zeal, reform the corrupt wayes of Worſhip, which is of the nature of Practical Tradition, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.2, 3, 4. and from thence received the determination of very conſiderable Points of Doctrine, which no Oral Tradition had brought down to him: to wit, what great wrath God had denounced againſt <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the neglect of keeping that Law, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.13, 19. This pious work of his, for which he was ſo highly commended by God himſelf, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.19, 20. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 23.25. <hi>That there was no King like him, before or after him,</hi> ſhould never have been performed by him, had he hearkned to ſuch a Tempter as this Diſcourſer. For 1. <hi>Joſiah</hi> could not more certainly know the Book of the Law, to be the Word of God, than Proteſtants now do the Book of Scriptures. 2. And <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> had only the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.13. and could then no more know the whole Canon of Scripture, than we do. 3. And before this Book was found, he knew not that theſe Scriptures were any where preſerved; and after it was found, having only one Copy, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably written by they knew not whom, he had not ſo much evidence of its integrity, as Proteſtants now have of the whole Scriptures, by the conſent of all Copies. 4. And if he was not capable of knowing the ſenſe truly, he ſhould neither have humbled himſelf, nor have refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:170758:182"/>
                     <hi>Judah.</hi> Thus we ſee it would have deſtroyed his Piety, to have been guided by theſe irrational Objections.</p>
                  <p>Conſider next the ſtate of Chriſtianity. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> When Chriſt came into the World, as he condemns the Traditions of the Scribes and Phariſees, which made void Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; ſo in the great Point of Faith concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who and what manner of perſon he ſhould be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt ſends his hearers to the Scriptures to learn, <hi>John</hi> 5.39. and S. <hi>Peter</hi> when he ſpake of the glory of the Transfiguration, yet ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>We have a more ſure word of Prophecy, to which you do well to take heed.</hi> Yet the <hi>Jews</hi> then had no more certainty than we have, that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are Gods Word, how many Books there are, that they were preſerved entire, that they were rightly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, and rightly copied; and that they had the right ſenſe. Now he who thinks not this a Rule ſure enough, to reject the then contrary Traditions of the Scribes and Phariſees (as that he muſt be a great Temporal Prince, and ſuch like) muſt own the Phariſees to be rather in the right, than our Saviour and his Apoſtles. And yet all theſe Arguments of our Diſcourſer would here take place, even thoſe which concern Tranſlations; for at that time the <hi>Jews</hi> (who after the Captivity did not commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>Hebrew</hi>) did make uſe of, ſome the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack</hi> or <hi>Chaldee</hi> Tranſlations, which though of <hi>Hebrew</hi> Original, as much differs from it as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the <hi>Saxon;</hi> and others, and thoſe very many, of the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion, which is as much different from the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> is from either of them.</p>
                  <p>His §. 9, 10, 11. contain what he would perſwade his Reader, a Proteſtant would ſay againſt his Diſcourſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> which he undertakes to anſwer. Theſe things concern not us who have already returned our own Anſwer, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than to let him know, that ſober Proteſtants do not ſpeak ſo weakly and abſurdly, as in ſome things he there repreſents them.</p>

                  <p>§. 12. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> He ſayes, <hi>Some will reply, fundamentals are clear in Scripture.</hi> True indeed, ſome do reply to this purpoſe, and not only Proteſtants, but the ancient Fathers, upon the like occaſion. Thus <hi>Origen</hi> when <hi>Celſus</hi> in oppoſing Chriſtianity, urged the obſcurity and uncertain ſenſe of Scriptures, <hi>Orig. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cont. Celſ.</hi> anſwers, <hi>That whatever was uſeful for their hearers to underſtand, and might confer any thing to the amending of their lives, theſe things the Prophets ſpake without all covertneſs, according to the will of God. But ſuch things as were myſtical, and matters of higher enquiry and ſpeculation, than the vulgar were capable of, theſe things they declared by allegories and dark ſayings. Auſtin, de Doct. Chriſtiana, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. ſaith, <hi>Among thoſe things which are plainly ſet down in Scripture, are found all thoſe things which contain faith and manners.</hi> And <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> with his Council of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in their Synodical Epiſtle to <hi>Jovian</hi> the Emperour, tell him, <hi>That the true and religious faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is plain to all, being both known and read out of the divine Scriptures:</hi> and all theſe ſayings include fundamentals being clear in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Againſt ſuch Anſwers or Replies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> he (who ſhould firſt have conſidered, whether his Church had ever given a Catalogue of Traditions in Points <hi>de fide,</hi> or can yet agree to do it, which he knows they cannot; againſt himſelf as well as againſt reaſon) tells us, <hi>That a perfect Catalogue of fundamentals was never yet agreed upon, and without this all goes to wrack;</hi> and then he enquires, <hi>Whether this be a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, that Chriſt is God?</hi> and <hi>Whether this be clearer in Scripture, than that God hath hands, feet, noſtrills and paſſions like ours?</hi> Concerning the Catalogue of Fundamentals, though as to matters of meer belief, Proteſtants have oft aſſerted, that the Creed contains them all; yet the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch a Catalogue, in this caſe, from Proteſtants, as it is needleſs, ſo to a ſober Enquirer will ſeem ridiculous: and the only true way to diſprove this Aſſertion, is to ſhew ſomething to be fundamental, which is not plain enough in Scripture to be thence believed. To put a like caſe,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:170758:183"/>If I ſhould aſſert, That in <hi>England</hi> may be had all things, which are neceſſary for the convenient ſubſiſtence of man: would it not be a thing ridiculous to ſay, that till I could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh all things neceſſary for this ſubſiſtence, from things unneceſſary, and produce a Catalogue of them, this cannot be truly aſſerted. For, ſuppoſe ſuch an enumeration of things neceſſary attempted, if any thing be omitted, which to another ſeems neceſſary, and is in <hi>England;</hi> or if ſome thing be inſerted, which ſeems not neceſſary, and yet is in <hi>England,</hi> ſtill this aſſertion of all things neceſſary for ſubſiſtence being here, may ſtand good, and can no way be diſproved, but by ſhewing, that there is ſomewhat neceſſary for mans ſubſiſtence, which cannot be had in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I ſuppoſe this Author did diſcern, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> and therefore will here venture to inſtance in a Fundamental not clear in Scripture; but I think he will come off with very bad ſucceſs. It is concerning the Divinity of Chriſt, which we own a fundamental: and if this Author ſhall ſay it is not ſo plain in Scripture, as thence to be believed, he muſt contradict S. <hi>John,</hi> who tells us, he wrote for this purpoſe, that <hi>we might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, John</hi> 20.31. So that he muſt either grant, that this is ſo plain in Scripture, that there is ſufficient evidence there for our believing it; or elſe he muſt ſay, that when the Evangeliſt wrote that we ſhould <hi>believe him to be the Son of God,</hi> he had no eye to our believing his Divinity, or his being God; and he who will ſo aſſert, will deny this to be a fundamental; or elſe he muſt ſay, that the Evangeliſt, and the Holy Ghoſt who inſpired him, miſtook in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing enough written to declare his Divinity. But he here ſeems to object, and elſewhere, that ſome who ſeem to follow the letter of the Scripture deny this, as the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> What then? This is not for want of evidence in Scripture, but from making or deviſing wayes to avoid this evidence. Will this Author ſay, that there was no evidence, of there being Angels and Spirits, amongſt the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:170758:184"/>
                     <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> who had opportunity of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all ſuch evidence, believed neither Angel nor Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? And will he ſay, that there was no clear evidence from the Word of Chriſt and his Miracles, that they <hi>were from God,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and other unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> who converſed with him, and ſaw his Miracles, and heard his Word, yet did not acknowledge them <hi>from</hi> God.</p>
                  <p>Now if this be ſo clear from Scripture, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> as thence to be believed, and that God hath hands, feet, and paſſions like ours, be not ſo delivered, as I ſhall ſhew in anſwer to his next Diſcourſe, where he urgeth this again; then I may ſafely and truly conclude, that the Divinity of Chriſt is much more clear in Scripture, than the other. Indeed that God hath hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> like ours, I know not of the leaſt intimation of any ſuch thing in the letter of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, though it ſhould not be allowed the common and uſual Figures of Speech, which are intelligible enough to men of Reaſon; ſince when it ſpeaks of Gods Hand or Arm, or the like, it plainly ſhews them not like ours, as God ſaid to <hi>Job,</hi> Job 40.9. <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God, and canſt thou thunder with a voice like him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two properties therefore of the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> are agreeable to Scripture, notwithſtanding all this Author hath jointly objected againſt it.</p>

                  <p>IN §. 1. and 2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> he layes down his third Property of the <hi>Rule of Faith; That it muſt be apt to ſettle and juſtifie thoſe unlearned perſons, who rely undoubtingly upon it; that this may be done, ſuch a perſon, <hi>he ſaith,</hi> muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on ſuch Principles as he takes to be true ones. Thus he cannot act in receiving Scripture; becauſe as he can himſelf have no ſelf-evidence of its being Gods Word, ſo it is ſenſeleſs for men to believe a multitude, which ſayes, it may poſſibly err in what it tells them. Or if here skill in Hiſtory, Language or Fathers, may ſecure them from error, this he cannot judge of: And principally when he conſiders, that they who pretend to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, differ, and condemn and perſecute each other; his reaſon will tell him, that ſince there is but one truth, for want of the light or directive power of that Rule, they all but one party, and may be that alſo, go miſerably aſtray.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, The Principles which he relies on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> who cloſeth with Scripture, are ſuch as may abundantly ſatisfie him; which indeed will follow from what was ſaid to the former Diſcourſe, concerning the rational evidence he hath of the Scripture. What he adds, that it is ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to receive Scriptures as Gods Word, from the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a multitude, who ſay they may poſſibly err; is, if not a ſenſeleſs, yet a very unaccountable Aſſertion. Will he think that nothing can be credited that is ſeen by the eye, becauſe in a miſt or ſome dark place, the eye may be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly miſtaken? or can there be nothing truly known by
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:170758:185"/>the underſtanding of a man, becauſe he who is Maſter of the beſt reaſon, may in ſome things miſapprehend? if this Author would thus argue, he muſt diſclaim all pretences to demonſtrations and Science, yea, and certainty likewiſe in all things in the World. We know in common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs that all men are capable of being miſtaken; where they have not ſufficient evidence: and yet we do not thence diſcredit the preſervation of Records and Charters, as if that could be no way aſſured, ſince we know men are capable here of ſufficient evidence to inform them; and Proteſtants are no more fallible, nor acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no more fallible than all men are; that is, they may be deceived where they have not ſufficient light, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to diſcern by: but where they have this light, and diſcern and receive it, there they neither are, nor can be deceived; and ſuch evidence as we have ſhewed, they have of the Scriptures; ſo that the knowledge thus ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Proteſtants, is infallibly certain, not from the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the perſons, as if they were no where liable to error; but from the infallibleneſs of the clear evidence of truth, which whoever receives, is certainly, as to that thing ſo evidenced, free from error. Yet we receive Gods Word not only from the delivery of Proteſtants, but of all ancient Churches, who yet were, and owned themſelves to be men ſubject to error. Yea, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and even the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> who pretend to infallibility, do alſo deliver all the Books we receive; but we have no more reaſon to believe them for this pretence, than we ſhould have to believe certainly all that man ſhall ſay, who hath the confidence to declare his tongue not liable to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter falſhood, when we can certainly know this very ſpeech cannot be truth.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing elſe in theſe Paragraphs which hath not been before anſwered, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſaving what he objects concerning the differences amongſt Proteſtants, which do not conclude Scripture which is our Rule, either uncertain, or not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently clear. For there are many things which many men
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:170758:185"/>over eagerly inquire after, and too raſhly determine, which, it may be, God did not think fit to determine in his word, though all things requiſite and neceſſary are clear enough; and there are many things clear enough in the Scripture, to diligent inquirers, whilſt ſome err about them by too haſtily cloſing with ſome conceptions of their own, not grounded on ſufficient evidence, and then too paſſionately promoting of them: and in neither of theſe caſes the Rule is to be blamed, but the perſons; and to one of theſe heads belong all our differences. This ſame Argument was urged both by <hi>Jews</hi> and Heathens, (and particularly by <hi>Celſus</hi> againſt Chriſtian Religion) as is related by <hi>Clem. Alex. Strom.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp; Orig. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cont. Celſ.</hi> who pleaded that Chriſtian Religion was not to be heeded and believed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they who profeſſed it, differed ſo much from each other, or oppoſed, contradicted and blamed each other, and many Hereſies were ſpread amongſt them. To which they returned anſwer, That ſuch differences were common in all caſes, where men entertained any thing by their judgments, if the things were any way eminent and excellent: ſuch there was amongſt Philoſophers who were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſuch amongſt the followers of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm;</hi> ſo that he who would cloſe with this Argument, muſt reject all ways of knowledge and profeſſions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. They obſerved likewiſe, that men will not refuſe all Phyſick, becauſe amongſt Phyſicians there are many various opinions; nor will Travellers refuſe to go in the Kings High-way, becauſe ſome went out of this Road<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to by-paths, which bring them to Precipices; nor ſhould we for this reject the Scriptures and Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but more diligently ſeek into them, ſince it is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that there muſt be <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and that the <hi>Tares</hi> will be with the <hi>Wheat.</hi> To this purpoſe thoſe Fathers anſwered for Chriſtianity; and the ſame anſwer pleads for us. But if this Author do indeed believe, that there cannot be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough in that Rule, where they who profeſs to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, are of different opinions; let him begin at home, and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:170758:186"/>put it into practice; and it will ingage thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion to renounce their <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> ſince it is plainly evident, that there have been many different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and high animoſities amongſt the pretended follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of that Rule; not only formerly amongſt the followers of different School-men, and their different Orders of the Clergy; but alſo more of late amongſt the Jeſuits, and the Prieſts of other Orders, more eſpecially the <hi>Janſeniſts;</hi> and the ſame continue to this day.</p>
                  <p>To all this I ſhall add, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that if by reaſon of the things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by this Authour, the Scripture be not now ſufficient to juſtifie him in his belief, who ſhall receive it as a Rule; then by the ſame reaſon were the <hi>Beraeans</hi> to be condemned, who ſearched the Scriptures to examine the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for which S. <hi>Luke</hi> commends them, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. Nor could they juſtifie <hi>Timothy's receiving them from a Child;</hi> yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> commends that in him, and ſayes, <hi>they were able to make him wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. For as they could have no more ſelf evidence of Scripture than we have; ſo they received theſe Scriptures from men whom themſelves believed to be fallible; for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures they received as delivered by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, which if they had not judged fallible, they could not have given heed to the Apoſtles Doctrine, which condemned much which was delivered by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and delivered other Doctrines by them not received. Yea, they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the delivery amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> certainly falſe, when they believed the Apoſtolical preaching. And even theſe <hi>Jews</hi> who delivered theſe Scriptures, did differ from each other, and condemn each other; which is evident not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in obſerving the three great Sects of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, Eſſens,</hi> and <hi>Sadduces;</hi> but alſo in obſerving the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions, betwixt the followers of the two great <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, <hi>Hillel</hi> and <hi>Shammai,</hi> who oppoſed one another to the death, even about the times of the Apoſtles. So that according to this Authors Principles he lays down, this was a ſenſeleſs proceeding of <hi>Timothy</hi> and the <hi>Beraeans,</hi>
                     <pb n="353" facs="tcp:170758:186"/>and they were no way juſtifiable. Nor can this Author plead that theſe perſons received the Scriptures from the delivery of the profeſſors of Chriſtianity as ſuch, though they ſuppoſed them alſo fallible in trying their Doctrines, ſince it is evident they cloſed with the truth of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by <hi>ſearching the Scriptures:</hi> and indeed even then there were great contentions amongſt the profeſſors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, as appears in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the obſervation of the Rites of the <hi>Moſaical Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since therefore we certainly know that they were ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable who received and relied on Scriptures as we do, and ſince his Objections to plead againſt us, appear no way rational, I may well aſſert this third Property to agree to Scripture.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> He propounds the Fourth Property of the <hi>Rule of Faith, to ſatisfie Sceptical Diſſenters, and rational Doubters; which,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>nothing but demonſtration can do, if they be true to their reaſon, and otherwiſe, their Faith it ſelf would be a vice. But if ſome things here were demonſtrable, yet it may be the task of a mans life, and this rational man would ſmile at his endeavours, who ſhould go about to demonſtrate all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult things here to be evidenced; That the Scriptures are the Word of God, having no real contradiction in them; that they are contained in juſt ſo many Books, and are ſtill preſerved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; that they are rightly Tranſlated, and that this is the ſenſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer; If by Sceptical, be here meant only inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> I have admitted this as belonging to the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> and do aſſert, that the moſt inquiſitive Diſſenters and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Doubters, may be ſatisfied concerning Scriptures, if they be willing to attend to ſufficient evidence; and be perſons who deſiring to have their ſouls ſaved, would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily chuſe that, which ſhall appear the beſt way to God. How all theſe things here mentioned may be known with ſufficient certainty, and by plain and natural evidence, and without ſpending a mans life in ſearching, we have ſhewed
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:170758:187"/>in anſwer to the former Diſcourſe. But theſe things are not indeed plain demonſtrations, nor are ſuch things as are matters of fact, capable of them, but of rational teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and evidences, which are ſo clear, that there can no rational way of doubting remain, where this evidence is diſcerned. Doth this Authour think that no man can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally judge himſelf to be the Kings natural Subject, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he can have no demonſtration that he was born in <hi>England,</hi> or other his Dominions? will he not eat or take Phyſick till he can demonſtrate that his Food or Phyſick are proper for his Stomach? either he counts a very ſmall rational evidence a demonſtration; or elſe daily acts in things concerning his life without it; and yet we have much greater ſecurity concerning Scripture, than a man can have in any caſe concerning the ſuitableneſs of his Food. If this rational man be to paſs the Seas, can he have no evidence of the ſafety of an Harbour, by the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners teſtimony, and a long teſtified experience, until he can demonſtrate there are neither Rocks nor Quickſands there? <hi>Obj.</hi> But where the ſoul is concerned, there is need of the higheſt evidence. <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is in this caſe need of ſufficient evidence to command aſſent; but if it would be folly not to receive ſuch things as may preſerve the life on ſufficient evidence, it is yet greater fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to receive ſuch things upon ſufficient evidence as may make the ſoul happy. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> while a <hi>Manichee,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>Confeſ.</hi> 6. <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>would have had ſuch certainty of things not ſeen, as of ſeven and three being ten; but at length he conſidered, how many things he had firmly received upon other teſtimony; as concerning places, and men whom he had not ſeen, and of what Parents he was born, and therefore reſolved it was reaſonable to cloſe with Scripture upon its ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral delivery.</hi> But let this Author begin at home, and he will ſoon ſee demonſtrations not neceſſary for ſatisfaction. The Council of <hi>Trent, Can.</hi> 4. <hi>De Baptiſm.</hi> anathematizeth them who ſhall ſay, Baptiſm is not neceſſary to Salvation; and <hi>Can.</hi> 11. <hi>de Sacramentis,</hi> requires a neceſſity of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:170758:187"/>intention in the Sacrament. Can this Authour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all the members of his own Church to Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to prove themſelves Baptized, becauſe it is a matter which concerns their ſouls? If he thinks the teſtimonies of Parents and Godfathers ſufficient; yet no rational man will call this a demonſtration, nor can theſe prove the intention of the Miniſter; yea, how can this Author or any other demonſtrate that he was the perſon who was ſeen at ſuch a time to be Baptized? If he will ſatisfie himſelf with the common teſtimonies of a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of credible perſons, in a matter where they were capable of diſcerning truth; this indeed will be a rational aſſent, and more than this cannot be expected; but this is not a demonſtration, but an evidence inferior in many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and thoſe conſiderable ones, to the evidence we have of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>He further ſays, he who would know the ſenſe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> muſt have great skill in Languages, Grammar, Hiſtory, Logick, and Metaphyſicks; that he may fully underſtand the phraſes, ſcope, and things delivered. I anſwer, all theſe indeed are neceſſary for the full clearing ſome obſcure and difficult Texts of Scripture; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome ſuch places may poſſibly not be yet fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; and if they be, it is only by perſons who have all theſe advantages, or by others from them. But about the plain and neceſſary things in Scripture, there is need of no more of theſe helps, than ſuch as are natural to every mans underſtanding. He who ſhall aſſert <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, Criticiſms,</hi> &amp;c. univerſally neceſſary to help men rightly to underſtand plain words; ſuch as in moſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are the <hi>Goſpels</hi> and <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and many other parts of Scripture, muſt aſſert, That one man cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand another, nor a child his Father, until he have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral <hi>Sciences;</hi> and ſo all delivery of words amongſt the Vulgar, and therewith the <hi>Romiſh Oral Tradition,</hi> muſt be utterly impoſſible, to come down in any thing, ſo much as one ſtep, either right or wrong, ſo as to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible.</p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:170758:188"/>
                  <p>But he ſaith, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 
                     <hi>his Sceptick may find ſomewhat to reply ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, or at leaſt, may maintain his ground of ſuſpenſe, with a, Might it not be otherwiſe?</hi> If he may do ſo, is this any fault in the <hi>Rule of Faith?</hi> or any excuſe to him to ſuſpend his <hi>aſſent,</hi> when he can make no rational exception? Were not the Miracles of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſufficiently convictive, ſo long as ſome <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſaid, Might they not be otherwiſe than from God? and was not all that Chriſt did and ſpake, enough to declare his Doctrine to be from <hi>God,</hi> and a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> not only ſaid, May it not be otherwiſe, but that it is otherwiſe? and muſt the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> now be needs made another thing by us, from what it was made in the beginning by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf? ſhall the <hi>Scripture</hi> now be required to have that condition of a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> which it is certain did not at the beginning of Chriſtianity belong to the <hi>Rule of Faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this ſatisfie not, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> ſuppoſe amongſt the <hi>Beraeans</hi> in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, there ſhould have been, or were ſome, of this Authors principles, who thought Faith a Vice, if not founded on demonſtration, and would ſmile at any man, who ſhould talk of demonſtrating ſo much of <hi>Scripture</hi> as was requiſite to found their belief in it, and ſo ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to aſſent to, and believe S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when others ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Scriptures, did believe: Will this Author ſo own theſe <hi>principles</hi> of this Diſcourſe, to ſay that theſe <hi>ſceptical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers</hi> acted more rationally, than S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Converts? and that they who believed his Doctrine by ſearching the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> did betray their reaſon, and their Faith was a Vice, when S. <hi>Luke</hi> owned them of a noble Spirit, and declared them to have ſearched diligently?</p>
                  <p>§. 4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> He comes to the fifth property, that it is <hi>convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of the moſt obſtinate and acute Adverſaries.</hi> Though <hi>obſtinate</hi> perſons are capable of no conviction, yet we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> is defenſible againſt all oppoſition; and is ſuch, that the moſt acute Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries may be ſatisfied concerning it, if ſufficient evidence will prevail with them. And this we aſſert concerning
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:170758:188"/>Scripture. He now ſuppoſeth a <hi>Deiſt</hi> to enquire, How we know the Book of Scripture to be Gods Word? and ſuppoſeth us to anſwer, By its excellencies. Theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies indeed give conſiderable evidence, eſpecially, as he ſaith, to eyes enlightned by faith; and do further ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and ſatisfie them; yet we need not, nor do not aſſert, this alone ſufficient to give a rational account to all men, without taking in how theſe Books were received, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the <hi>Church,</hi> as we formerly ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>But he ſaith, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> 
                     <hi>his Deiſt will ſhew you Texts againſt known ſcience, and in his judgement, contradictions.</hi> Will he ſhew <hi>Texts</hi> againſt <hi>known ſcience?</hi> but what if he cannot? and what if ſome expreſſions in <hi>Scripture</hi> are more ſuited to vulgar apprehenſions than the <hi>Scioliſts notion,</hi> ſhall any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſo excellent a Writing, becauſe it condeſcends to ſpeak intelligibly to the loweſt capacities? Nor where there is proof given of this being <hi>Gods Word,</hi> can ſeeming <hi>contradictions</hi> to his judgment be ſufficient not to receive it; ſince ſomewhat myſterious and ſublime may come from God; and to underſtand aright all things written by the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Scripture,</hi> it is requiſite to be acquainted with the circumſtances of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> meaſures, proverbial expreſſions, and the like; and then he might reconcile, as learned men have done, many things which now to him ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <p>But he ſaith, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> his <hi>Deiſt will ſhew you many abſurdities and Hereſies in the letter of Scripture, as that God hath hands, feet, and paſſions like ours.</hi> Here, as his former words are unſavoury, his latter are untrue. Scripture ſpeaks indeed of Gods hands and feet, but no where ſaith, he had ſuch like ours. Such things as are thus ſpoken of God in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, have a true <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe, if that may be called <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> which is <hi>tropical;</hi> and why may not Scripture be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to make uſe of <hi>Tropes</hi> or <hi>Metaphorical expreſſions,</hi> as well as all other Writers, and all Diſcourſers? where the ſenſe is eaſily diſcernable to reaſon, which is requiſite to be uſed, that we may underſtand any Writing. Now the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:170758:189"/>conſidering what knowledge we have of God by reaſon, and the pondering other places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which plainly ſpeak God to be a Spirit; and conſidering likewiſe, how theſe words of <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>feet, &amp;c.</hi> are oft uſed in a <hi>figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> ſenſe: this will plainly convince, that they muſt be underſtood ſo, when they are applied to God. When the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> by <hi>Tradition</hi> deliver, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> will they not expect, that mans common reaſon, and what they otherwiſe teach of the <hi>Church,</hi> ſhould teach all to allow a <hi>tropical</hi> ſenſe of the word <hi>Head,</hi> and not that they ſhould forthwith imagine, that that <hi>Church</hi> whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> is the <hi>Head,</hi> ſhould have the outward ſhape of Man, Woman or Beaſt? Thus <hi>Celſus,</hi> whoſe Arguments againſt Chriſtianity, were much of the nature of this Diſcourſers, makes this an Objection againſt Chriſtians, that they ſpeak unworthily of <hi>God;</hi> as of the work of his <hi>hands,</hi> the <hi>mouth</hi> of God, and the <hi>voice</hi> of God. And <hi>Origen, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cont. Celſ.</hi> thought it ſufficient to anſwer, that <hi>Chriſtians did underſtand all theſe in a ſpiritual, not a corporeal ſenſe; and that if</hi> Celſus <hi>had read other places of Scripture, he might thence know, that Chriſtians would not think otherwiſe of God.</hi> It is an unchriſtian aſſertion, to charge the letter of the Scripture (which is the very words of the God of Truth) with hereſie, where we have ſure ground of it's interpretation, both from other Scripture, &amp; from Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Againſt the latter he objects, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> that then we diſown the <hi>Scripture Rule, and make our Reaſon and other knowledge our Rule:</hi> I anſwer, when we include <hi>Scripture,</hi> we cannot diſown it; yet withal, we own <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as that whereby we judge of the ſignificancy of Words and Phraſes, as well in Scripture as elſewhere: he who doth not this, either doth not underſtand Phraſes, or hath a prodigious art of underſtanding without reaſon. Yea, we do profeſs, to make uſe of that knowledge we have of God by Reaſon, thereby to underſtand the better other expreſſions which concern God in Truths revealed; ſince we are certain, that God gave the Scriptures, as a further revelation to man,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:170758:189"/>who was ſuppoſed to have that Reaſon and Conſcience which God had endued him with.</p>
                  <p>But he further in §. 5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> challengeth the <hi>conſciouſneſs of our own thoughts, whether we do not bring thoughts along with us to interpret Scripture by, and theſe from Tradition, or what we have heard and received.</hi> Here I ſhall give him a true and faithful account of the Proteſtants carriage in this thing, which muſt be by a diſtinction of Perſons and Texts of Scripture. In ſuch Texts as appear plain where the neceſſary truths are contained, none of us bring any ſuch thoughts to interpret by, but diſcern the evidence plainly in it ſelf, and from thence we hold ſuch Truths as Points of Faith. In Texts of Scripture which appear more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, all Proteſtants do prepoſſeſs themſelves with ſuch truths as they have learned by plain Scriptures, or other certain evidence, and therefore know no difficult Text can be ſo interpreted, as to contradict any ſuch truth. Here the vulgar Chriſtians do ſuppoſe many times that to be the true ſenſe of ſuch places, which they have received from thoſe they judge able and faithful; but ſuch a ſenſe of ſuch Scripture, they do not own as a neceſſary Point of Faith, but admit it as moſt probable, untill themſelves be able fully to ſearch; and then if they diſcern this a true expoſition, they will receive it upon their own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but if they find it a miſtake, they will lay down that former apprehenſion, and will entirely be guided by what they ſee is the true ſenſe of Scripture. And perſons of great abilities to make the beſt ſearch into the ſenſe of more difficult Texts, do not prepoſſeſs themſelves with any particular ſenſe of ſuch Scripture, but are every where entirely guided by that which appears the beſt evidence to recommend any ſenſe, as knowing that it is not our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or benefit, that this or that opinion or interpretation ſhould be true in things doubtful; but our great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to own that which is, and God hath declared to be, the Truth.</p>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:170758:190"/>
                  <p>§. 6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> He enquires how we can demonſtrate <hi>concerning any place of Scripture, that it is not altered, and that</hi> [not] <hi>is not inſerted or left out?</hi> I anſwer, this as to any matters of Faith is diſcovered ſufficiently by what we ſhewed to prove the Scriptures preſerved entire in the foregoing Diſcourſe. Yea, the common principles of Reaſon and Conſcience in man, will evidence to him in many neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary truths, that if <hi>[not]</hi> was left out or put in, they could never have been from God. That God is Eternal, Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Good, and to be worſhipped of his creatures, that he treats man with great mercy, that men muſt be holy and righteous, that God will judge the World; ſuch things as theſe appear ſo evident, that man where-ever he hears them, cannot but acknowledge them to be true and from God, and that the contrary cannot be ſo. But further, the conſent of all Copies in ſeveral Countreys, is in this caſe an abundant rational evidence; eſpecially conſidering, that theſe Writings were diſperſed into all Countreys preſently after they were firſt written, and ſo no miſcarriage in the Faith could be in thoſe firſt Copies taken from the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, (of what this Author moves his doubts) which would not have been eaſily diſcovered and reformed, either by the ſurviving Apoſtles, or by the Original Writing or <hi>Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapha</hi> of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts; which doubtleſs being of ſuch high eſteem in the Church, were ſome time preſerved. Now ſince at the firſt diſperſing of theſe Copies, they did contain the Apoſtles Doctrine entire, the conſtant agreement of all Copies ſufficiently prove the ſame continued ſtill; eſpecially conſidering, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies which all appear to have this agreement, were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in ſeveral Ages long ſince paſt, and in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys. And that to imagine <hi>[not]</hi> left out or foiſted in, in the matters of Faith, in all Books generally and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likly and daily read by Chriſtians, muſt ſuppoſe 1. That they all every where in ſo many Countreys, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to falſifie the Faith of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which they appeared to value above their lives, and by this Tradition would be
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:170758:190"/>corrupted; but yet Scripture in all theſe Books could not, unleſs 2. They ſhould falſifie all the ancient Copies, which yet by the very writing appear to have nothing raſed out, or foiſted in. And this is a much higher certainty, than <hi>Joſiah</hi> could have of his own Copy; yea, than can be had of any paſſage in any Hiſtorian, ancient Law or Record; and if this we have ſaid, did not generally ſatisfie the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils propounded, all Hiſtory, old Laws and Records, muſt be rejected, becauſe there can be no ſuch appearance of ſo great evidence, that in any ſentence <hi>[not]</hi> was not left out or foiſted in. And ſo all matters of Fame or Tradition muſt be disbelieved, till he can demonſtrate, that they had not their original from the reading ſome Writings, which have the ſame liableneſs to miſtake with other Writings, and that <hi>[not]</hi> hath not been put in or left out in the Oral delivery. And how much his Reader will be beholden to him for ſuch conceits as theſe, we may gather from his own words, <hi>Diſc.</hi> 9. §. 4. <hi>where ſpeaking of humane teſtimonies, he tells us amongſt the moſt extravagant Opinionaſters, none was ever found ſo frantick, as to doubt them; and ſhould any do ſo, all ſober mankind would eſteem them ſtark mad.</hi> But as hath been proved, this Author would here lead his Reader ſuch a way, as himſelf ſaith, all ſober mankind will eſteem him mad, if he follow him. If this be not enough, I ſhall add, that the Primitive Chriſtians owned ſuch a tryal of Scriptures incorruptneſs, as fully ſufficient for them to rely on, and to confound all who oppoſed it. And even this Argument of this Author, though urged with greater confidence, was that with which ſeveral of the Hereticks, from the time of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> to S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> oppoſed the Chriſtians; amongſt which I ſhall now only mention the <hi>Manichees</hi> out of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that whilſt he was a <hi>Manichee, Confeſſ. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 2. he was ſomewhat ſhaken by hearing a diſpute between <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lpidins</hi> and the <hi>Manichees:</hi> but the <hi>Manichees</hi> afterwad pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately told him, The N. Teſtament was corrupted, and there was no uncorrupt exemplar produced; but this did as little
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:170758:191"/>ſatisfie him. And after he became an oppoſer of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees. Contra Fauſtum, lib.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 1. he urgeth againſt them Scripture teſtimony; to which <hi>Fauſtus</hi> anſwers, <hi>That this Scripture teſtimony was not right.</hi> To which Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> replies, <hi>If this anſwer be eſteemed of any weight, what written Authority can ever be opened? what holy Book can ever be ſearched? cap.</hi> 2. he demands proof of <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> what Books ever read otherwiſe, and <hi>c.</hi> 3. urges, <hi>All Books new and old have this teſtimony, all Churches read it, all tongues conſent in it, therefore put off the cloak of deceitfulneſs.</hi> And in <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 19. he ſaith, <hi>he read the Scripture which is placed in the moſt ſublime and celeſtial height of Authority, being certain and ſecure of its truth:</hi> but (ſaith he) <hi>the Manichees contend that many things in the Scripture are falſe;</hi> yet ſo, that they do not aſcribe falſhood to the Apoſtles who wrote them, but to ſome which have corrupted the Books: but becauſe they cannot prove this by any ancient Copies, he ſaith they are overcome, and confounded by the moſt manifeſt truth.</p>
                  <p>But our Diſcourſer ſaith, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> 
                     <hi>It is certain there are many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious readings, yea, ſo many in the New Teſtament alone, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by my Lord</hi> Uſher, <hi>that he durſt not print them, for fear of bringing the whole Book into doubt.</hi> We acknowledge there are ſeveral various readings; but this ſpeaks the greater ſecurity of this Rule, becauſe though all theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings are preſerved, yet according to any of them, there is a conſent in all the matters of Faith; unleſs there be ſome manifeſt miſtake in any Copy, which may eaſily be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to be the Scribes or Printers error: nor amongſt all theſe readings, can any point of Chriſtian Faith be ſo doubted of, that it is not capable of receiving ſufficient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence from ſome Texts. And though this Authour would pretend, that from theſe various readings, there is an uncertainty in all things in Scripture, which is contrary to all reaſon; yet others more knowing and learned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, are ſo ingenuous as to grant what I here contend for. <hi>Bellarmine de Verbo Dei lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2. aſſerts, that the errors of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:170758:191"/>Tranſcribers in the Old Teſtament, are not of ſo great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the integrity of the Holy Scriptures ſhould be wanting, in thoſe things which belong to Faith and Good Manners: <hi>for the moſt part</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the whole diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the various readings, is placed in ſome little words, which either do not at all,</hi> or <hi>do very little alter the ſenſe.</hi> And <hi>ch.</hi> 7. he declares, that he aſſerts the ſame concerning the New Teſtament, which he there aſſerted concerning the Old. Indeed before the time of Chriſt, there were more various readings in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> than there now is in the <hi>New;</hi> as may appear not only from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Cheri</hi> and <hi>Ketib,</hi> and the <hi>Tikkan Sopherim,</hi> and ſuch like, which are probably more ancient; but alſo becauſe the Copies uſed by the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and <hi>Samaritan,</hi> differed in many various readings from the <hi>Hebrew Copies</hi> uſed by the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſt,</hi> which probably were moſt in uſe in Chriſt's time, and after received by the <hi>Maſoreths;</hi> and yet ſince they all agreed in the ſame points of Doctrine; Chriſt and his Apoſtles both had recourſe to them, and ſo perſwaded others: and we think it is ſafe for us to follow ſuch examples. The Vulgar may here conſider our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Engliſh Tranſlations,</hi> which as to expreſſions have in moſt Verſes ſome difference, and in ſome few places the one may give a ſenſe ſomewhat different from the other; yet ſince it is but in very few places where they do not all agree in the ſence of the place; and where they do not, yet none of them do aſſert any truth of Doctrine which the others either do not aſſert, or do deny; the common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may hence ſee that which may make them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the more ſecure than doubtful of theſe truths, becauſe the latter <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> though differing in words, yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in all Doctrines with the former. And if there be the ſame variety of readings in ſeveral <hi>Tranſlations</hi> in other Languages, this is no more than is in our <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But as for the <hi>Originals,</hi> though there be ſeveral various read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yet in compariſon of our <hi>Engliſh Tranſlations,</hi> but one for many; and yet fewer places where the ſame ſenſe
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:170758:192"/>of that <hi>Text</hi> is not expreſſed by ſuch readings, though in ſome ſmall difference of words; which difference of words was occaſioned partly from ſeveral of the <hi>Fathers</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Scriptures, as is with all men frequent, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the very ſame words, but words of the ſame ſenſe; from whence many of theſe various readings in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> had their Original; or partly that the <hi>Scribes,</hi> or they who copied the Scriptures, might have ſome miſtake, where yet the ſenſe remained intire for the moſt part.</p>
                  <p>But he inquires, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> Why may there not have <hi>been ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious readings formerly, in thoſe places which now appear in all Copies we have to agree? which various readings may poſſibly have been blindly determined, and ſo miſguide us in the main points of Faith.</hi> I anſwer, That ſince there are very many ancient <hi>Copies,</hi> and <hi>Commentators</hi> and <hi>Citations</hi> of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> which fully accord with our preſent readings; and ſince there are ſome ancient <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> as <hi>Syriack, Latine,</hi> and others; all which agree in the ſame, and ſince there is an accord in theſe Books ſcattered and diſperſed over the whole World: if there had been any ſuch different rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, they muſt be every where determined, before theſe ancient <hi>Copies, Commentaries</hi> or <hi>Citations</hi> were written, before the ancient <hi>Tranſlations</hi> were made, yea, before the <hi>Copies</hi> of the Scriptures were diſperſed into the ſeveral Regions of the World: and this is to imagine that there muſt have been ſome general alteration determined, in the great matters of Faith, whilſt the hand writing of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> was preſerved, yea, even in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> daies, which is impoſſible unleſs the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to whom Chriſt committed his truth, and their Converts who were nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and prized this Doctrine above all the World, ſhould all againſt the clear evidence of their own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the Original Writings of the Apoſtles then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, conſpire to corrupt this Doctrine, and to fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifie the <hi>Records</hi> which contain it; which to aſſert, is not only highly unreaſonable, but exceedingly impious
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:170758:192"/>and blaſphemous, nor would it leave Oral Tradition ſafe.</p>
                  <p>How much all this ſpeaks to common ſenſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in a caſe which is very parallel. Suppoſe a Jury in any caſe of concernment, ſhould obſerve an hundred Witneſſes produced, examined aſunder, and every one of their atteſtations written, and one by one read to them; as to the great matter to be proved, every one of them agree fully, and not ſo much as one diſſents: will they not judge this a ſufficient evidence of any thing ſpoken, though in ſome of theſe atteſtations, there be ſome ſmall difference in a word, though not at all to add or leave out any conſiderable ſenſe? yea, Will they not think, the teſtimony the more firm as to the things atteſted, becauſe they all agree firmly in them, though they never met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to conſpire ſo to correct one another, that there might not be a ſyllable different in their words. The Scripture certainty of points of Faith, is much greater than this, ſince the Copies, every one of which gives its atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are abundantly more numerous; and withal the main points of Faith are not only expreſſed in ſome one Text of Scripture, but in very many places, where there is a concurrence in all theſe Copies; which ſpeaks theſe truths more certainly free from all poſſibility of error. Yet beſides all this certainty, we have much in the end of Scriptures writing, and therein Gods care of it to aſſure us that it is not corrupt: of this we ſpake ſomewhat in the former Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>What he ſpeaks of <hi>Biſhop</hi> Uſher, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> 
                     <hi>obſerving ſo many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious readings in the New Teſtament, which he durſt not Print for fear of bringing the whole Book into doubt.</hi> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation manifeſts it ſelf to be ſuch a ſtory, as I think neither this Author, nor any man of reaſon, either <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>Papiſt,</hi> can believe, upon ſerious conſideration, if he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al judge Biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> to have been a very knowing man. No underſtanding <hi>Proteſtant</hi> can believe this, becauſe he knows that <hi>Proteſtants freely</hi> inquire after various readings,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:170758:193"/>and never the more doubt of Scriptures; becauſe there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſo full a conſent in all material things. Nor can I imagine that either this Author or any underſtanding <hi>Papiſt</hi> can believe this ſtory; for ſince it appears to be much their deſign, to bring the <hi>New Teſtament and Old</hi> likewiſe ſo far into queſtion, that it might not be capable of being a Rule: if they thought in truth that <hi>Archbiſhop <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> obſerved ſo much of various readings, as would ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually do this, it cannot be doubted they would ſoon collect and publiſh ſuch various readings, or procure ſome other to do it; unleſs they do imagine that that was obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Biſhop <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> which cannot be obſerved by any other man. Now as their not performing this, perſwades us Proteſtants, that the Papiſts themſelves do not believe this ſtory, ſo it diſcovers to us that we have no reaſon at all to believe it our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thus having diſcovered the Doubts moved by this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſer not to be acute and convictive; we conclude that this Property notwithſtanding theſe Doubts, doth belong to Scripture, that it is defenſible againſt the moſt acute Adverſaries, and there is ſufficient evidence concerning it, to prevail with them.</p>

                  <head>An Anſwer to the fourth <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> ſhewing, that the two laſt Properties of the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> do agree to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</head>
                  <p>§. 1. THeſe two laſt Properties are <hi>Certainty in it ſelf,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <hi>and aſcertainableneſs to us. That the latter cannot agree to Scripture, is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>of his foregoing Diſcourſe,</hi> and depends upon the former, its being certain in it ſelf. What he urged in his foregoing Diſcourſe, I have in mine anſwered, and ſhall now examine what he writes againſt the certainty of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. To ſhew Scripture not certain in it ſelf, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he tells us, <hi>the material Characters in Books may be burnt, torn, blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, or worn out, and this he calls a deep conſideration; becauſe it would be a diſorderly proceeding to lay ſuch a weak means, for ſo main an end as the ſalvation of mankind.</hi> Theſe are indeed but vain and empty words, which he calleth his <hi>deep conſideration.</hi> For doth this Author imagine that there is no certainty in any other Records which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, becauſe they conſiſt of matter capable of periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? and where did he learn, that nothing which is not of the moſt unalterable nature in the World, muſt be made the means of mans ſalvation. Let this <hi>deep Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> think whether after the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to come out of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Seed, this Seed could not be a means for the Salvation of mankind; becauſe <hi>Iſaac</hi> might poſſibly have been killed before he had any Seed, and all his Children were mortal men; and was there not a much greater poſſibility then of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s death, before he
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:170758:194"/>had any Seed, or of all his Seed after, than there now is of all the Copies of Scripture being deſtroyed? And may not the ſame be urged concerning the Seed of <hi>David and Solomon?</hi> Yea, ſo perniciouſly dangerous are the aſſertions of this Authour, that they would tempt men to reject the ever-bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as well as the Scriptures. But dare he ſay that the life and Miniſtry of our Lord Jeſus could not be a means for the ſalvation of mankind, becauſe he was in our nature lyable to death, and to him who only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders this nature, it might ſeem poſſible he might have died, before he had declared all Goſpel-Doctrine? But this empty and vain conſideration of this Author, hath its foundation, either in imagining the World without a God to order it, or at leaſt in ſuppoſing that the means of mans ſalvation muſt have their effect from the ſtrength of nature, and not from God, who can uſe the weak things of the World to confound the Mighty.</p>
                  <p>But the Scriptures are not ſo lyable to be deſtroyed as any thing elſe in nature, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as this Authour falſely aſſerts. Was there but one Copy to be found, as it was in <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s time? if this was in the hands of a profeſſed enemy to Religion, there might be fear of the Scriptures being loſt, if we had no eye to Divine Providence. But ſince there are ſo many millions of Copies, and the number yearly increaſed, and theſe in the hands of many thouſands, who would hazard their lives to preſerve them; there will appear more reaſon to fear, that all the generation of mankind now growing up, ſhould periſh and die before they come to their full ſtature, and ſo mankind ceaſe, for want of propagation, than to imagine that all the Copies of Scripture ſhould be deſtroyed: For as it is certain that in every generation many thouſands die in their infancy, or childhood; ſo there can be no demonſtration, nor ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional proof that all ſhall not, unleſs it be by conſidering the Providence of God: and as a Copy of Scripture is in it ſelf much more durable than the life of a man, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by many Copies written ſeveral ages ſince; and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:170758:194"/>theſe Copies are more capable of lying undiſcovered from the eye of an enemy than a man is, who muſt be where he may have food to preſerve him; ſo there is as much reaſon to eye or hand of Providence in preſerving Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as in preſerving mankind. For theſe Scriptures never could be deſtroyed, when there were not ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Copies, as now there are. When the <hi>Jews</hi> only had theſe. Oracles of God, many learned men are of opinion, that <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and ſome that <hi>Amon</hi> deſigned the deſtroying all Scripture Copies, yet there was one left which was found in the Temple, and brought to <hi>Joſiah. Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> relates, <hi>Antiqu. Jud. lib.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 7. made the ſame attempt, but could not effect it. And after Chriſt, the ſame was indeavoured by <hi>Diocleſian, Euſeb. Hiſt. Eccl. lib.</hi> 7.20. but ſuch deſigns prevailed not, and yet <hi>then</hi> there was not probably one Copy of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for ſome hundreds <hi>now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea further, if the caſe ſhould be ſuch, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that no Copy of Scripture was to be found, it is not impoſſible with God (who could have raiſed <hi>Iſaac</hi> from the dead, if he had been ſlain) by extraordinary meſſengers to renew the Scriptures, if they were not otherwiſe to be had. God hath taken other care by his Providence for their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet thoſe ancient Fathers (as <hi>Tertullian de Habitu Muliebr. c.</hi> 3. <hi>Clem. Alex. Strom.</hi> 1. <hi>Irenaeus adverſ. Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 25. and S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> &amp;c.) who were of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Scriptures then written were loſt at the time of the Captivity, did aſſert them again reſtored by <hi>Ezra.</hi> But that Poſition of the Scriptures then being loſt, is explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the moſt learned and judicious <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ad An.</hi> 180. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others, not only as being an <hi>Apocryphal</hi> ſtory, contradicted in <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.1, 2. but by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> in the place cited, it is expreſly declared, <hi>not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſince they had at leaſt as many Copies of Scripture as Synagogues, yet none of them ſhould be preſerved.</hi> Much leſs can they now be loſt, ſince it is not improbable that there are now as many thouſands of Copies, as were then <hi>Jewiſh
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:170758:195"/> Synagogues.</hi> Hence we may obſerve that what this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour calls his <hi>deep conſideration,</hi> as it hath no rational foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, ſo it hath not the advantage to be one of his own <hi>Church Traditions,</hi> and ſhews there may be ſomething de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered for truth which was not ſo received. And of the ſame nature are almoſt all his Arguments againſt Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures being the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 3. He further adds, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> That <hi>the material cauſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe Characters, are lyable to innumerable contingencies; but mans mind by its immateriality, is in part freed from Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical mutability; and here we may with reaſon hope for an unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terableneſs, and an unerrableneſs, if there be a due propoſal, which muſt neceſſarily effect the ſenſe.</hi> Theſe words are more monſtrous than rational; it is as much as in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> to tell his Reader, that having an immaterial ſoul, he can never forget any thing that he either ſaw or heard diſtinctly; and that when he hath read a Book obſerving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all the words and letters may be more exactly known from him, by the impreſſions upon his mind, than by viewing the Printed or Written Copy it ſelf. And yet all this will not ſerve his turn, unleſs it be ſuppoſed that theſe immaterial ſouls muſt alwaies continue in the World, or that what was by them received, muſt thence neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily in the ſame manner be continued on others. Who ſees not that this is as much againſt common ſenſe, as if he had ſaid, That becauſe man hath an immaterial ſoul, he may flie up to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and fixed <hi>Stars</hi> at his pleaſure? Was Man of the nature of Angels, without his groſs Body? its beyond the skill of this Authour to prove, that nothing could be forgotten or blotted out of his mind that is once known, eſpecially conſidering that he is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and even the Writers of his own Church do conceive, that ſinning Angels loſt much knowledge by their ſin. But man is a Creature of another mold, and letters and words, and things are preſerved in his memory, by mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial impreſſions and every man knows they may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; yea, this Authour in this Book oft forgets and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:170758:195"/>himſelf. Do not all mankind appear ſufficiently convinced, that words or characters are more ſurely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in paper, or writing than in mens memories, in that what they would have faithfully kept, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to writing, and enter it upon Record? Had the <hi>Jews</hi> been of this <hi>Authours</hi> opinion, they would not have deſired <hi>Ezra</hi> to have read the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> out of a Book, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.1. but to have ſpoken it out of the impreſſions of his own mind: yet he would have been a more ſafe delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of <hi>Moſes,</hi> than the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> can ſhew for other Scripture. Yea, it is plain and ſelf-evident, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> agree with the reſt of mankind, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge writing upon ſome material ſubject, a more ſure way of preſervation of things than the minds of men; for they write the Acts of their Councils, and Statutes of their Societies, and yet theſe things are as much (or more) ſpoken of amongſt them, as the Scriptures are, and ſo more like to be preſerved in their immaterial minds; yea, they write or print their Creed, Prayers, Leſſons, and their whole Liturgy, and have them read in their Churches; when by this Authors Argument, the beſt way to have theſe things preſerved intire, is to have them uttered from the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Prieſts and others in the Church; and not to mind the Writing or Printing at all, as not being in it ſelf certain. The <hi>Roman Church</hi> know that mens minds are ſlippery, and apt to forget ſomething in their Liturgy, if it were not written; and that others would take the boldneſs to alter it, and vary from it, if they had no writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Rule: and ſhall writing be the beſt preſervative for all other things, and not for the words of the Scriptures, and the truths therein contained? I remember <hi>Salmeron,</hi> tho' a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> hath among the reſt of his <hi>prolegemena,</hi> one which is <hi>Proleg.</hi> 25. <hi>Why the Scriptures were written? and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares</hi> (as every one who deſigns to ſpeak truth would do) <hi>that it was that thence men may moſt ſurely know truth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the memories of men are very ſlippery and uncertain:</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> aſſigns a like cauſe of the Original of Letters, <hi>de
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:170758:196"/>Doctr. Chriſtiana, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 4. Nor can I imagine for what end the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> prints Copies of the Bible, if they did not think that by thoſe printed Copies, the Scriptures might be known and preſerved.</p>
                  <p>And as if it was not ſufficient abſurdity without any colour of ſolid reaſon to contradict the experience of all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliz'd Nations; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> he at once oppoſeth even the wiſdom of God himſelf alſo, who commanded the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>write him a Copy of the Law in a Book, and read therein all the daies of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God,</hi> Deut. 17.19, 20. Yea, he commands <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>write for a memorial in a Book,</hi> Exod. 17.14. Yea, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Write it before them in a Table, and note it in a Book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever.</hi> And though God himſelf declares this the way of keeping the memorial of things; this Authour rejects this way, and cloſeth with the uncertain way of mans frail memory.</p>
                  <p>§. 4. He tells us, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> That as <hi>there are ſome ſimple vulgar actions unmiſtakeable, yet there are compound actions, as the tranſcribing of a whole Book, conſiſting of myriads of words, ſingle letters and ſtopps, and the ſeveral actions over each of theſe are ſo ſhort and curſory, that humane diligence cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to every of them. Yet,</hi> he grants; <hi>that this may be done with care enough, if there be diligent Examiners.</hi> This Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſpeaks againſt the common ſenſe of every one who can write; for it tells him that no man can poſſibly keep to the ſenſe or words he intends in writing a Letter, or ſuch like, though he hath a Copy before him. For he who can write a page with due care, may by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the ſame diligence, write a ſheet; and if he want nothing elſe, but what concerns his writing, he may with the ſame care write a Book. What extraordinary art hath this Diſcourſer, that he could write his Book intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly, and the Printers print it ſo? can none do the like? He cannot be ignorant that theſe things may be done by common diligence; and all men who underſtand writing
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:170758:196"/>acknowledge that Deeds and all Records may be exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and faithfully tranſcribed, if there be had due care about it. That there hath been ſuch care about Scripture; I ſhall ſhew in anſwer to his next Paragraph. And I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he is not ſo ſelf-conceited as to think, that other men may not uſe as much care in writing Letters or Words, as himſelf doth or can.</p>
                  <p>But if this little Argument of many little actions not being capable of due attention, was conſiderable, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> it would concern this <hi>Authour</hi> to find a way, how the <hi>Papiſts</hi> may know the definitions of the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> eſpecially ſuch a way as he intimates, <hi>p.</hi> 211. it is not hard for <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to find. For to run to the Printed Books which contain the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> of that <hi>Council,</hi> here preſently appears the multitude of little actions both in the Printing and firſt Copying. If he ſhall tell us, they receive the <hi>Canons</hi> of that <hi>Council,</hi> or any other, not as they are in Books, but by <hi>Oral Tradition;</hi> I ſhall then examine whether there be not the ſame and greater difficulty about ſuch <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For it is certain, that there are as many miſtakeable little actions in ſpeaking a word as in writing it; every tittle requiring the pauſe in the voice, and every letter pronounced, being a diſtinct framing of the Organs of Speech: and both experience and reaſon will tell a man, that he may more frequently miſtake in ſpeaking a word, than in more leiſurely writing it by a Copy; ſince ſpeech is more quick, and admits not of ſo long conſideration, for every little action as writing doth, and every man knows that where there are many phraſes and ſentences, there may be ſomewhat ſooner omitted in ſpeaking where he hath no outward help for his memory, than in tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, where the memory is perfectly relieved by the Copy before him. So that in the way of <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> beſides the ſeveral little actions of the Organs of Speech, there are other little actions of the Memory, more lyable to the error, than the eye is in viewing a Copy. Hence it will appear, that this Authors perſwading men in this
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:170758:197"/>§. 4. to account Scripture not to be certain in it ſelf, is built upon this foundation, That God hath not indowed man with ſo much wiſdom and diſcretion, as to guide his ſpeech, or hand ſo, as to ſpeak or write intelligibly, or according to his meaning or intention. And this is as much as to ſay, That men cannot converſe with one another, and that no truth can be delivered from one to another, no nor falſhood neither; and he who will be perſwaded to this, will not be a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> nor a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> neither a man of any Religion, nor of any Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. He tells us, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> 
                     <hi>If it were certain that there was care taken for the faithful tranſcribing the Scripture, much might be ſaid thence for its certainty: but as it is capable of many miſtakes, ſo eſpecially in the</hi> New Teſtament, <hi>experience te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies there hath been no ſuch diligence, by the divers readings of the ſeveral Copies, and thouſands of corrections of the</hi> Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar edition. His Objection to diſprove the uſe of care, eſpecially in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> muſt be firſt anſwered, and then we ſhall evidence that there hath been abundant care. What he ſpeaks of the <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> which is the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> in requeſt in the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> and made uſe of by many others; the thouſands of corrections he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſpeaks that <hi>Church</hi> none of the beſt preſervers of Records, But after all theſe corrections, was there any point of Faith or Manners, wherein after the corrections, it differed from what it was before the corrections? if it differed in none, then ſuch various readings do not declare the Scriptures even in <hi>that Tranſlation,</hi> in any thing to miſguide, in diſcovering whatever concerns Faith or holy life, though ſuch <hi>various readings</hi> ſhould remain. But if the <hi>Vulgar edition</hi> did differ in any ſuch matter of Faith, or holy life, this would condemn the <hi>Roman Churches Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which hath profeſſed to own and receive what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was in the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> both before its correction and ſince; and ſo muſt differ from what it was, in that point of Faith or Manners. Touching various readings in the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Copies,</hi> and almoſt all, if not all <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:170758:197"/>there is no difference in any point of Doctrine, nor conſiderable in words and phraſes. And though it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to prove concerning every ſingle Copy, that it was faithfully tranſcribed, by giving an account of the manner how it was done: yet there remains an abundant rational proof, that the <hi>Copies</hi> of the Scripture, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> have been generally writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with much fidelity; becauſe the ſeveral Copies which may yet be ſeen, written in ſeveral Countries and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Ages, ſhew ſuch an agreement in them all, and in the Ancients citations of them, that they ſpeak one thing, the ſame truth, and with ſo very little variation of any word, that to a diligent attender, this ſpeaks much of care, attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diligence in tranſcribing. To all this I add, that it is certain that the <hi>Ancients</hi> were very induſtriouſly accurate in their tranſcribing Books, and made it a great point of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be attentive in it, even in other Books, and no doubt more eſpecially, about the holy Scriptures, and did to their <hi>Copies,</hi> ſubſcribe their Names, that it might be known by whom they were written. What exact diligence the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi> uſed in tranſcribing Books, may be obſerved from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, related by <hi>Euſebius, Eccleſ. Hiſt. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 20. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Book of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> at the end of which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> wrote thus: <hi>I adjure thee who ſhalt tranſcribe this Book, by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by his glorious preſence when he cometh to judge the quick and the dead, that thou compare what thou ſhalt tranſcribe, and amend it diligently, according to this Copy, whence thou ſhalt tranſcribe it, and that thou ſhalt likewiſe tranſcribe this Oath, and put it in thy Copy.</hi> And this, he ſaith, he thought profitable to put in his Hiſtory, that in this thing they might have example of the care and diligence of thoſe ancient and truly holy men. If ſuch care was to be taken of <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s Works, ſurely no leſs of the holy and Divine Writings.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. He goes about to ſhew, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 
                     <hi>That Scripture cannot be certain as to its ſenſe eſpecially, to the Vulgar, where he repeats, that Arts and Sciences are neceſſary to underſtand the Letter;</hi>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:170758:198"/>which was before ſaid by him, and is above anſwered, <hi>Diſc.</hi> 3. §. 7. and need not here be repeated. He further tells us, That <hi>an acute Scholar can blunder the conceptions of the Vulgar concerning Scripture, and give them a ſeeming clearer interpretation of his own.</hi> In many points of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie and difficult Texts, we acknowledge <hi>a Scholar</hi> may do ſo; but it is no way neceſſary that the <hi>Vulgar</hi> ſhould be able to determine them, and be firmly ſetled in the knowledge of them; but in matters of Faith more plainly diſcovered, it is otherwiſe. If he thinks they may be perſwaded by a <hi>Scholar</hi> to think any other ſenſe more clear, than that which offers it ſelf, and is obvious in ſuch phraſes as theſe; That <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt; that he was born of the Virgin,</hi> and <hi>died for us,</hi> and ſuch like; he muſt find men of much lower capacities than <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are, and indeed ſuch as cannot underſtand the meaning of what that <hi>Scholar</hi> ſhall ſpeak, (ſince he cannot ſpeak plainer words) and then I know not how they can be perverted by him: yea, ſuch men are not ſo much as capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtructed at all in the knowledge of Faith, or matters of mere belief, unleſs this Author can diſcover ſome other way of inſtruction in theſe things, than by plain words. But doth not this cavil ſtrike at all wayes of knowledge, and even at <hi>Tradition</hi> as much as <hi>Scripture?</hi> For if the plain words of Scripture may be perverted by a <hi>Scholar,</hi> are not the words delivered by <hi>Tradition</hi> capable of being in the ſame manner perverted? If not, it muſt either be becauſe the ſame words written or read, cannot have ſo plain a ſenſe, as when they are ſpoken without reference to any Book; or elſe the Teachers of the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> muſt be thought wiſer than the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in that they can ſpeak the plain truths of God better, and with leſs lyableneſs to miſtake, than the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> wrote, who yet profeſſed to uſe plainneſs.</p>
                  <p>But he asks, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> 
                     <hi>when we ſee</hi> Proteſtants <hi>and</hi> Socinians <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe, as they conceive, of the beſt advantages the letter gives them, yet differ in ſo main points as of the Trinity, and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:170758:198"/>of Chriſts Divinity; what certainty can we promiſe to weaker heads?</hi> I anſwer, weaker heads may well enough be ſatisfied with that evidence, which men of greater parts through prejudice do not entertain. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> the wiſe men of the World who pretended to be guided by the beſt evidence, did not all agree in ſo main a point, as which was the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whether <hi>Chriſtianity, Judaiſm,</hi> or <hi>Gentiliſm:</hi> will it thence follow that there was no expecting that men of ordinary capacities ſhould diſcern evidence enough to perſwade them to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and that there was no rational hopes of their converſion, though many thouſands of them believed? Or in the matter now in hand? can he imagine that until all learned men of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> are agreed, in ſo main a point as which is the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> no ordinary capacities can he ſatisfied concerning this Rule upon any ſolid grounds? I am confident himſelf doth not think ſo, and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are fully certain of the contrary. In like manner, Proteſtants in general, even the Vulgar, appear fully ſatisfied about the <hi>Trinity, and the Divinity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from the evidence which Scripture gives to theſe great truths: yea, ſo plain are they in Scripture, that he muſt be acute in deviſing waies to evade the evidence of theſe truths, who doth not receive them: nor can we think that the <hi>Socinians</hi> could either deny theſe truths, or entertain their own way of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if it was not that theſe truths are above the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of man to comprehend; (as it is rational to imagine much is, which concerns the Infinite Divine Being) and that they do too much magnifie reaſon, in not receiving any thing which reaſon cannot conceive how it is or may be: and ſo in truth it is not their making Scripture the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> but rather in theſe points, the ſetting up another Rule, and making Scripture the thing ruled, which is the cauſe of their not owning theſe truths.</p>
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:170758:199"/>
                  <p>Having now anſwered all his Objections, and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Scripture from all his Cavils; I may conclude that THE SCRIPTURE HATH ALL THE FOREMEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONED PROPERTIES BELONGING TO THE RULE OF FAITH.</p>
                  <p>After this §. 7. <hi>he excuſeth himſelf, as not having ſpoken this againſt Scripture upon his own principles, but that all he hath ſpoken</hi> (as he ſaith, but I have ſhewed the contrary) <hi>follows upon the Proteſtants principles.</hi> This ſpeaks him to act a part in the diſgracing Scripture, which he is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to own; and therefore he here acknowledges high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies in theſe ſacred Oracles. For if he indeed think, there can be no certainty of Scriptures being the Word of God, and of the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> from the <hi>Churches</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and of the uncorruptneſs of it as to Faith, from the agreement of <hi>ancient Copies,</hi> then he muſt without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation profeſs, that upon his own Principles all thoſe imperfections are attributed to Scripture: ſince the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> yea the <hi>Popes</hi> themſelves have acknowledged, that they have none other way to be aſſured of theſe things by; and reaſon will evidence they can have none other, which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cannot have as well as they. But if he thinks there be any certainty in theſe proofs, he muſt acknowledge that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who own theſe proofs, have this certainty.</p>
                  <p>But he ſaith, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> all he deſigns is, <hi>That Scripture is moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for a</hi> Rule of Faith, <hi>and was never intended for ſuch; as may be evinced, becauſe the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors, went not with Books in their hands, to deliver Chriſts Doctrine, but with words in their mouths; whence</hi> Primitive Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>learnt their Faith before thoſe Books were univerſally ſpread among the Vulgar, much leſs the Catalogue acknowledged.</hi> What he ſpeaks of the Apoſtles not having Books in their hands, either refers to the Books of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or of the New. As to the Old Teſtament, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that both Chriſt and the Apoſtles ſometimes had them in their hands, and, which is moſt conſiderable, had them
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:170758:199"/>ordinarily in their mouths, to declare from thence the Doctrine of Chriſt. Thus Chriſt <hi>beginning at Moſes and all the Prophets, expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himſelf,</hi> Luke 24.27. And S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 17.2, 3. <hi>reaſoned out of the Scriptures, opening and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging;</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> Act. 18.28. <hi>convinced the Jews, ſhewing by the Scriptures that Jeſus was Chriſt;</hi> which being in the <hi>Synagogue</hi> it is not much to be queſtioned but they had with them the Books of the Scripture, as was the manner of the <hi>Jews</hi> teaching, as we read 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.9. <hi>they taught in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and had the Book of the Law of the Lord with them.</hi> And had not <hi>Philip</hi> the Book of the Prophet which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded when he converted the <hi>Eunuch?</hi> But poſſibly he meant they had not the Books of the New Teſtament in their hands. Indeed before they were written, they could not have them, nor could they then be a Rule. However the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts teſtimony was then and now is the Rule to know what was delivered by Chriſt; but their teſtimony by Speech was temporary, and could not remain after their death; while this continued it was a <hi>Rule of Faith:</hi> but they alſo had another way of teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which was by Writing, and this as it continues with us, is to us a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> becauſe their teſtimony; and ſo S. <hi>John</hi> calls his Goſpel his teſtimony, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.24. and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe of his Epiſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.12. What he ſpeaks of the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors, not having their Writings in their hands after they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, is a groſs falſhood, as will more plainly appear, from what in the end of this Book may be obſerved from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authorities of the Ancient Fathers. Yea, S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> with other <hi>Apoſtolical men,</hi> went to preach to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> with the Epiſtle of the <hi>Synod of Jeruſalem</hi> in their hands, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.22. which was the firſt New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment writing; and <hi>Euſebius</hi> relates, that S. <hi>Mark</hi> carried his written Goſpel, and preached it in <hi>Egypt, Hiſt. Eccleſ. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 11. and S. <hi>Peter himſelf</hi> made uſe of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Writings, and commended them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15, 16. and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:170758:200"/>ſo did all the Ancient Fathers of Apoſtolical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
                  <p>He is bold to ſay, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> 
                     <hi>That the Revolters from Primitive method, cloſed with Scripture as the Rule.</hi> But in truth, when the World erred by <hi>vain Tradition,</hi> it was none other than God himſelf who wrote the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and gave the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, to guide the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> And when <hi>Phariſaiſm,</hi> that great Hereſie, was maintained by <hi>Tradition,</hi> they who laid Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as the Rule againſt it, were none other than Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who referred to the Scriptures of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and gave forth the Scriptures of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But he ſaith, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> 
                     <hi>Scripture as it is made the</hi> Rule of Faith, <hi>is brought to the vileſt degree of contempt, and every upſtart Hereſie fathers it ſelf upon it.</hi> But who contemns it? not <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who make it their Rule, and they who do will be highly guilty, as were the deſpiſers of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who was alſo contemned and deſpiſed of men. But is this a cauſe of contempt, if all Hereſies pretend to it? do they not all pretend to the right worſhipping the true God, the true following of Chriſt and owning Chriſtian Religion as well as to the Scriptures? and are theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things the more contemptible, becauſe they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to them? yet it is falſe, that all Hereſies have pretended to Scripture. For as ſome have denied Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as it is witneſſed by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian;</hi> as ſome have gone to revelation and ſecret wayes of delivery of Doctrine, as the ſame Authors ſhew, and the Hiſtory of <hi>Simon Magus, Baſilides, Marcion, Manes</hi> and others evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: ſo others have pretended to the publick Church-Tradition, continued to their time. Thus did the Hereſie of <hi>Artemon in Euſ. Hiſt. Eccleſ. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 27. who declared, <hi>That Chriſt was only man, and their Anceſtors</hi> (they ſaid) <hi>had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this unto them, to be not only that which the Apoſtles receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Lord, but that which they generally taught, and was continued until the times of</hi> Victor; and that <hi>Zephy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi>
                     <pb n="381" facs="tcp:170758:200"/>(who ſucceeded <hi>Victor</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in whoſe time theſe Hereticks lived) <hi>corrupted this teaching.</hi> It ſeems this Hereſie had numerous followers or Atteſtors, in that it is there ſaid in <hi>Euſebius, it might have had much probability, if it had not been contradicted by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and the Writings of the Ancient Brethren.</hi> Yea, theſe very Hereticks did indeavour to alter and corrupt the Scriptures, ſo far they were from making them a Rule.</p>
                  <p>He further ſayes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> 
                     <hi>The many Sects in</hi> England <hi>flow from this Principle of Scripture being a</hi> Rule of Faith; <hi>and it is a wonder this doth not oblige men to renounce that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which is the neceſſary Parent of ſuch diſorders.</hi> This hath been anſwered, <hi>Diſc.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 3, 4. ſo far as concerns difference of opinions. But that all the <hi>Sects</hi> in <hi>England</hi> do ariſe from this opinion of the Scriptures being the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> is very far from truth: for Firſt, it is certain that ſome of theſe <hi>Sects</hi> do not profeſs it to be their Rule; I ſuppoſe he knows there are ſome of his perſwaſion, that make <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> their Rule, and he knows there are others who pretend to be guided by the <hi>Light within</hi> them; and the way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing theſe <hi>Sects</hi> is by receiving this general truth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, other <hi>Sects</hi> or <hi>Parties</hi> of men there are, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed profeſs to follow theſe Scriptures as their Rule; but it is not their owning, but their not right uſing them, which is the occaſion of their error: it is their over raſhly entertaining their own conceptions, without ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and unprejudiced inquiry, as if they were plain in Scripture, and neceſſary Doctrines, when indeed they are not; and the true way for healing theſe <hi>diſtempers,</hi> is by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide ſuch raſhneſs and prejudice, reſolving to cloſe with that only as neceſſary Doctrine, which upon impartial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry appears plain in Scriptures, and to uſe ſerious diligence in ſuch inquiry, and this is to act according to <hi>Proteſtant Principles,</hi> yea, according to the Doctrine of Chriſt, who did not give ſuch direction to the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who ſtrictly profeſſed to own the Law, but denied the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:170758:201"/>that the way to be free from their error, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that Rule; but blamed them as not knowing the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and declared that therefore they did err: and if this was truly heeded, all diſorderly <hi>Sects</hi> would be at an end. But on the contrary, ſhould we reject theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſcoveries of God, becauſe they have been abuſed by the ſin of man, to the promoting many <hi>Sects,</hi> where ſhould we leave? when Chriſtians imbraced the Doctrine of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and what was delivered by the Apoſtles: many Sects hence took occaſion all to pretend to this Doctrine: muſt Chriſtianity therefore be alſo diſclaimed? and with much greater reaſon muſt not all Controverſial Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſpeculations in <hi>Theology</hi> be abandoned, becauſe they are the Parents of many Sects and Diviſions even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Papiſts?</hi> and muſt not all reaſonings and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions be diſclaimed, becauſe they are the original of ſo many diſputes and different <hi>Sects,</hi> both in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Divinity.</hi> This would be the way to renounce being men, and being Chriſtians. Thus the rejecting the Scriptures would be taking Poyſon inſtead of Cure: yea, it would be as if the food uſed amongſt civilized Nations ſhould be prohibited, and their civil rights diſclaimed, becauſe many abuſe the former by intemperance to ſurfeits and Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and the latter is the occaſion of War, Strife and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and therefore that men ſhould live only on <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns,</hi> and ſuch other Fruits of the Field, and without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Poſſeſſions as Wild men, that they may be thereby out of theſe dangers. Who ſees not that temperance and a peaceable ſpirit would be the beſt preſervatives from theſe dangers, and would make the ſtate of man and of the World excellent? and though there might then remain ſome infirmities in the Conſtitution either of the Body Natural or Politick; yet none ſo great as would be occaſioned by rejecting the courſe of a civilized life: ſo if the abovementioned <hi>Proteſtant Principles,</hi> were put in practice, there might remain ſome <hi>different</hi> apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and opinions; yet none ſuch as would be either
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:170758:201"/>dangerous or diſturbing: but as the perſons might have Faith and Salvation; ſo both Church and State might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their peace and quiet.</p>

                  <p>BEfore I come to diſprove what is delivered by this Author on the behalf of his way of Tradition; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it will be requiſite firſt to ſtate the Queſtion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Oral and Practical Tradition; and to ſhew what we grant concerning it, and what we deny; that ſo it may after appear, how far we have cleared the truth of the Proteſtants Aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>We aſſert the faithful delivery of Chriſtian truths by word of mouth, to be a very uſeful way to bring many to the Faith, or to eſtabliſh them in it; and we doubt not but that very great Multitudes who have not the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of uſing, reading or hearing the Scriptures, may by this means be brought to believe. Such was the caſe of ſome barbarous Nations in the Primitive times, and of many Pagans in theſe later times. But ſince the ceaſing of the extraordinary gifts of revelation in the Church, the moſt faithful delivery of theſe truths is that which is guided by the Scripture, and takes that for its Rule; and ſuch are the ſober inſtructions of knowing and well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and no other delivery can be faithful, but that which is agreeable to the Scripture, and its ruling
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:170758:202"/>Power: and this was the commendation <hi>Irenaeus</hi> gave to <hi>Polycarp, Euſ. Hiſt. Eccl. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>that he delivered all things conſonant to Scriptures.</hi> Yet though this way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery by word of mouth is very uſeful, yet it was then only a ſure <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> when theſe truths were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them who were inſpired of God, and thereby were infallible in their delivery: and ſuch was the delivery by the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts both in their preaching and in their Writing. Next to the Apoſtles, but not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them we would value the delivery of Apoſtolical men. But in after-ages, we deny any certainty of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible delivery of truths, in the way of <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> and acknowledge that only a certain delivery which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſuch, by its accord and agreement with the Scripture Rule.</p>
                  <p>And as to the ſenſe of Scripture, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> we doubt not but when God gave the Primitive Church gifts of interpretation, there was a delivery of the ſenſe of Scripture, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in plain and neceſſary things which are obvious from the words, but even in many more hard and difficult Texts of Scripture. Yet all obſcure Scriptures were not even in thoſe times explained, and their explications generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: ſince S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of many things in S <hi>Pauls E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles</hi> which were hard to be underſtood; which if the interpretation of them had been generally delivered, and received in the Churches in Gods name, they could not have been. The great and neceſſary Doctrines were then received, and delivered according to the true intent and meaning of Chriſt; and that was agreeable to the Scriptures. Hence the delivery of any truth to all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Apoſtles times, and its being received by them ſo far as this could be made evident, was a very uſeful way to deſtroy Hereſie; yet the Fathers who made uſe of this way, did alſo ſhew, that theſe truths were plain in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. To theſe Churches, ſo far as the Doctrine by them received can be manifeſted, we would willingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal for a trial of Controverſies, and do readily imbrace
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:170758:202"/>ſuch truths, as by ſure evidence appear to be the Doctrine held by thoſe Churches. Partly as thus delivered, and chiefly as clear in Scripture, we receive thoſe Articles of Faith contained in the <hi>Creed,</hi> commonly owned in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church:</hi> but the Creed we conceive to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a much more ſure and ſafe way than Oral Tradition, ſince the words of it, have with common conſent been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, fixed and determined; the want of which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Tradition, doth manifeſt it to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alterable, and uncertain in other Doctrines. But that all points of Chriſtian Doctrine, or Apoſtolical interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of hard Scriptures, are infallibly delivered from the Primitive Churches, by the way of <hi>Oral</hi> and <hi>Practical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> we deny. Nor can there be more reaſon to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, that the preſent delivery of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> doth faithfully preſerve ſuch Doctrines and interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than would alſo perſwade, that when <hi>Ezra</hi> read the Law, and cauſed the people to underſtand the ſenſe of it, we might certainly find the Doctrines by him taught, and the interpretations by him given, amongſt the <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees;</hi> as ſurely as we could have them from <hi>Ezra</hi>'s mouth, or from them who heard him, and were faithful relaters of his teaching.</p>
                  <p>I will only further here obſerve, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that <hi>Tradition</hi> may be conſidered, either as a meer ſpeculation and notion; and thus a man may imagine a conſtant delivery of the ſelf ſame things, truths and actions, by the ſucceſſions of ſeveral generations, without conſidering whether there really be any ſuch delivery, or whether it can be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally expected: and to treat of ſuch a <hi>Tradition</hi> as this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> is but to diſcourſe of aiery fancies and imaginations. Or elſe <hi>Tradition</hi> may be conſidered as ſomething reall and in being; and thus we may inquire, whether ſuch a <hi>Tradition</hi> as is to be found in the Church, or in the World, be a ſure way to deliver truth infallibly to Poſterity. This is that we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> deny, and if this Author intend not the proof of this, he will ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:170758:203"/>to the purpoſe; and will only ſhew that ſuch <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> as they of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other in the World have not, might be the <hi>Rule of Faith:</hi> and notwithſtanding all this, they will be deſtitute of it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now examine his Diſcourſes of <hi>Tradition,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> in which every Reader will be able to obſerve, that he hath made no proof conſiderable, unleſs he hath ſaid more for the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> than can be ſaid to prove Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion not corrupted before the Flood, or after the Flood amongſt the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> or before the <hi>Captivity,</hi> and at the time of <hi>Chriſt</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi>

                  <p>§. 1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Coming to inquire whether that <hi>Tradition</hi> be the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> which he calls <hi>Oral</hi> and <hi>Practical,</hi> he thus explains it: <hi>We mean a delivery down from hand to hand, (by words and a conſtant courſe of frequent viſible actions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to thoſe words) of the ſenſe and faith of the fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Our buſineſs in this Diſcourſe, is to inquire whether this can be a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> which the Diſcourſer affirms, and Proteſtants deny.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> To underſtand this way of <hi>Tradition,</hi> he obſerves on this manner; <hi>Children learn the names of Perſons, Rooms and things they converſe with; and afterwards to write, read, and uſe civil carriage. And looking into the thing, they gain the notions of ſeveral objects either by their own ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or by the help of having them pointed at; and this he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, is the conſtant courſe of the World continued every Age, yea, every Year or Month.</hi> This is <hi>Tradition</hi> in Civil mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Concerning this Tradition it may be obſerved, that about matters viſible to ſenſe, the Objects or Things, and the names of the things muſt be diſtinctly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The common notions of Objects viſible, as of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Earth, Sun, Moon, Rooms, Man, Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are by common apprehenſions even of Children received from Senſes, not by <hi>tradition</hi> of a former Generation; and thoſe apprehenſions are preſerved by the view of the viſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But the words, or names, are indeed delivered in ſuch a way of <hi>Tradition:</hi> but words thus delivered, are not
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:170758:203"/>alwaies preſerved from alteration and change: yea, even at <hi>Rome,</hi> notwithſtanding this way of delivery, wherein the following Generation have received their Language from their Fathers; yet if they who converſed there in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times, were now alive, they would diſcern ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of ſpeech, and even in ſpeaking mens names, that they would not be able to underſtand their preſent language: and if they can ſhew no greater ſecurity for the delivery of their Doctrine, than of their Language; that alſo may be as much changed, notwithſtanding their help of <hi>Tradition.</hi> And it may be further obſerved, that thoſe Languages which in this way of <hi>Traditional Learning,</hi> are groſly corrupted, and even loſt; ſuch as <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin;</hi> yet in Books and Writings, they are faithfully preſerved: which ſhews, Writings more ſure keepers, or preſervers of words and civil things, than this way of <hi>Tradition</hi> is. It would be needleſs to ſhew, that in Writings and civil behaviour, there is as great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation in ſome few ſucceſſions of Generations: for this is ſufficiently known to all obſerving men.</p>
                  <p>§. 3, 4. He applies this to Chriſtianity; and ſaith, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 
                     <hi>So Children get by degrees notions of God, Chriſt, Saviour, Hell, Virtue and Vice; and are ſhewn how to ſay Grace and Prayers; afterwards they become acquainted with the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Creed, Sacraments, forms of Prayer, and other practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſtianity; the actions and carriages of the elder gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the younger, to frame their lives to ſeveral virtues by the Doctrine delivered in words; as Faith, Hope, Charity, Prayer,</hi> &amp;c, To this I anſwer; That Children do indeed by degrees learn the Notions of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> alone is not that which guides them here; but alſo the Scriptures and Ancient Writers, are of great uſe, as they inable the Teachers of the foregoing Generation to guide them more faithfully. Indeed in the way of this <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> alone, ſome general ſignification of words which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern matters of Faith, may probably be delivered: as that God ſignifies him, whom we are to worſhip, reverence, ſerve
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:170758:204"/>and obey, and ſuch like. But more particular notions of theſe matters of Religion, as they may be ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved aright; ſo where is no other way of preſervation, than this <hi>Tradition,</hi> they may be very corruptly and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly delivered. It is certain that <hi>Noah</hi> knew the true God, and taught his Children concerning him, and in his daies, and ſince their Poſterity increaſed to great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; and yet having only this way of <hi>Tradition,</hi> they were ſo far corrupted in their knowledge of God, that they owned Creatures, yea, the loweſt of Creatures for God, and thereby loſt the knowledge of the true God: and yet even the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who worſhipped other things inſtead of God, pretended that this they received by this way of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</hi> and this was their great Argument, why they ſhould not receive Chriſtianity, becauſe their Anceſtors had delivered to them that way of Worſhip they then u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Heatheniſm. Clemens Alexand.</hi> in his <hi>Admonition</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> brings them in ſpeaking thus, <hi>We muſt not reject thoſe things which were delivered to us from our Fathers:</hi> and almoſt all the Fathers who write againſt <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly ſhew the vanity of this their plea.</p>
                  <p>The ſaying of Prayers and Grace aright, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> depends much upon the preſervation of the true Notions of God and Chriſt, and the knowledge of Duties and Promiſes: and therefore if there be any corruption in the delivery of thoſe things, it is like to be alſo in the performance of theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Prayer and ſaying Grace; in which caſe will the carriages and practices of the elder Chriſtians be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But he ſayes, they learn the Creed, ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and forms of Prayer. The Creed is indeed a good preſervative of the chief Articles of our Belief. Had it not been for this Form, and ſome other like it received in the Church (which becauſe written, and in ſtinted words, is more of kin to the way of Scripture delivery, than to other delivery by <hi>Oral Tradition;</hi> it is like theſe points of Faith might have been rejected or loſt among them who only hold unto the way of that <hi>Tradition.</hi> The ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:170758:204"/>are likewiſe a ſure preſervative of that which God requires in them from man, but theſe are the words of Scripture. Neither the Creed, nor the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, concern the Controverſie of <hi>Tradition,</hi> as it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> otherwiſe than to obſerve the way whereby the certainty of them is conveyed unto us; and thus we do aſſert, that we are more certain of the Creed, by its being committed to Writing, and comprized in a fixed form of words, and being every way agreeable to Scripture, than any can be by way of delivery from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Son only by word of mouth, in all ſucceſſions of Generations: and the ſame certainty we have of the ten Commandments, by their being in the Scripture Records, and being likewiſe delivered in writing; which is the way which even <hi>Papiſts</hi> make uſe of as well as others. What he adds of Sacraments and forms of Prayer, theſe are like to guide men aright where the notions of Religion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them are preſerved intire; but if there be a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Religion, theſe things, as ſoon as others, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, as indeed they are in the <hi>Romiſh Church:</hi> where though the Creed and the Commandments do deliver much truth; yet are they ſomewhat perverted by <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Expoſitions,</hi> nor can they ſecure from the delivery of many other corruptions.</p>
                  <p>In §. 5. He deſires us to conſider, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 
                     <hi>How the Primitive Faithful were inured to Chriſtianity e're the Books of Scripture were written or communicated.</hi> We know this then was by the preaching of the Apoſtles among them, who had the inſpiration of God to guide them, and were unerrable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers; and yet even they in this preaching made very great uſe of the Books of the Old Teſtament, to prevail with men to receive the Doctrines of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> But I ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind him, that the Chriſtians at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtate of that Church, before they had any written Scripture of the New Teſtament, thought it requiſite, for the inuring themſelves to Chriſtianity, to obtain ſome Writings Apoſtolical, concerning whom <hi>Euſebius</hi> writes
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:170758:205"/>thus: <hi>At</hi> Rome <hi>the light of Religion did ſo ſhine upon the minds of theſe hearers of</hi> Peter, <hi>that they thought it not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to content themſelves with once hearing him, nor with the unwritten Doctrine of the Divine preaching: but with all manner of perſwaſions, they did earneſtly deſire</hi> Mark <hi>who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed</hi> Peter, <hi>that by writing he would leave them a memorial of that Doctrine, which was then delivered to them by words: nor did they deſiſt until he did perform it; and this was the cauſe of the writing that which is called, The Goſpel according to</hi> Mark. He likewiſe relates; <hi>That when the Apoſtle knew what was done by the revelation of the Spirit, he was pleaſed with the forwardneſs of the men, and by his Authority confirmed the Writing, that it might be read in the Churches.</hi> This ſame Hiſtory is related alſo both by <hi>Clemens,</hi> and by <hi>Papias: and after this,</hi> Mark <hi>preached in</hi> Egypt <hi>that ſame Goſpel which he had written.</hi> Thus <hi>Euſebius Hiſt. Eccleſ. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10, 11. and to the ſame purpoſe, relating the words of <hi>Clemens, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>But our Diſcourſer tells us, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> 
                     <hi>He dare affirm that</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians <hi>and</hi> Proteſtants <hi>adhere to their Faith, becauſe their Fathers or Paſtors taught them it, and not upon the evidence of Scriptures letter to their own private judgements; becauſe they who are brought up under Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>are apt to follow him; and others Mr.</hi> Pierce. To this I anſwer, That Proteſtants value the judgements of their Teachers, if they think them to be learned and good men; but yet in the Articles of Chriſtian Faith, and the great truths of God, they do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern other grounds, and ſurer to rely on, than the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Teachers; and therefore whatever Teacher ſhould contradict ſuch truths, they would not follow him. And if any perſons are ſo unſtable, as in ſuch things to be led away by the Authority of any men, they are far from being grounded Proteſtants. In ſome matters more difficult, or Controverſial, many Proteſtants are not capable of being better ſatisfied, than by the judgment of their Paſtors, and are to be commended for following them: yet in this caſe, they own not their judgment as a <hi>Rule of their Faith;</hi> but
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:170758:205"/>the beſt help to their underſtanding in a caſe of difficulty. But if any Proteſtant by miſapprehenſion do cloſe with ſuch things controverſial, as neceſſary points of Faith, if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he diſcerns them matters of Controverſie, not clear in Scripture, or that the contrary is rather true and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Scripture, he will then ſubmit his former apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to the greater evidence now received. And by this means through diligent examining, very great multitudes of Proteſtants, who have given up themſelves impartially to follow Scripture truth, have received ſome opinions different from ſome particular opinions of their Parent or Teacher. And even all other Proteſtants, who are not capable of making trial of the grounds of all controverted opinions, yet unanimouſly will acknowledge, that the trial of any truths by the Scripture, is much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, than by any Teachers judgment; and therefore if they were capable, they would much rather chuſe to be ſtedfaſtly fixed in any truth by the former, than to be only perſwaded to it by the latter. Whence it appears, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> generally own only the Scriptures for their Rule. And were there ever any who deſired to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> or any Science, deſigning therein to follow reaſon as their Rule, who were not as much gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by their Teachers or Inſtructers, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are by theirs? that is, to value their Authority or opinion, until by examination of it by the Rule, they ſhould diſcern it an error.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. He tells us, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> 
                     <hi>That Objections made againſt a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> afflatus, <hi>and againſt the</hi> res traditae, <hi>or things deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtead of Tradition it ſelf, can have no force againſt his opinion.</hi> I ſhall not diſpute the truth of theſe things, but ſhall ſo far ſatisfie this Authour, as to aſſure him, my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing anſwer ſhall proceed neither of theſe waies.</p>
                  <p>§. 7. He tells us, <hi>The firſt Property of the</hi> Rule of Faith, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> 
                     <hi>doth agree to Tradition: to wit, it is evident to all, as to its exiſtence; becauſe we ſee and hear daily ſounds and actions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Practical Doctrines conveyed down to us.</hi> But is this all
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:170758:206"/>that this Authour thinks neceſſary to be proved? Did he not demand much more concerning Scripture, than that the Book might be ſeen, and the words heard? did he not then require proof that Scriptures are Gods word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Surely it is not only requiſite, that ſome thing ſhould be delivered and received; but at leaſt it muſt be neceſſary for every Generation to know that all that Faith which the former received and profeſſed, is fully delivered and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received by them. For ſince, as himſelf ſaith in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, <hi>Tradition</hi> is the open conveyance of Doctrines, if they be either not delivered or not received, there is no conveyance, and ſo a failure of the thing it ſelf, which is <hi>Tradition.</hi> Now we aſſert, that there can be no certainty of any ſuch exact delivery in any one Generation ſince the Apoſtles daies, and that for theſe reaſons. Firſt, becauſe many matters, eſpecially in difficult things, may be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for want of right underſtanding, and then theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes will be delivered. That they are miſtaken by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, appears by the diſagreement of great numbers, and diſputes about ſeveral Doctrines, whether they be <hi>de fide,</hi> or not; and about the ſenſe of <hi>Papal Decrees</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Councils:</hi> whence it is certain they do not all apprehend the truth; or at leaſt, will not confeſs they do; which will as much overthrow <hi>Tradition.</hi> Secondly, It's poſſible, that through the prevalency of corruption and ſin in a. Generation of men, they may much loſe that knowledge of God which they had, even in matters of Faith, and then cannot deliver it aright. It's certain it was thus in the Generations after <hi>Noah,</hi> in that great point concerning the true God and his Worſhip; and there was then as much to be ſaid from the nature of <hi>Tradition,</hi> as now among <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be now no ſecurity to the contrary, unleſs the piety of all Ages could be demonſtrated; which the great complaints of the Teachers of ſeveral Ages renders impoſſible. Thirdly, becauſe through the working of mans thoughts in apprehending, and conſidering, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining truths, many things are concluded as conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:170758:206"/>and explications of truths, which were not received from the former age: thus in almoſt all the Books and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and in the Book of this Authour, are many particular aſſertions, conſiderations and ſpeculations, which were not received from the open <hi>Tradition</hi> of the foregoing Age; and they are here delivered, and may hence by others be received. Fourthly, there may alſo be a combination (through great viciouſneſs, or diſreliſh of truth) againſt ſome particular truth, which oppoſeth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the outward intereſt, or the corrupt life. Thus God complains of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Jer. 5.30. <hi>The Prophets propheſie falſely,</hi> and <hi>the Prieſts bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it ſo.</hi> Fifthly, there may poſſibly be an omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the delivery of many things to be delivered and true: and I dare ſay, it is impoſſible for this Author, to prove upon his Principles, that all truths are handed down from one Generation to another, either amongſt the Learned or the Vulgar: and yet it will concern him to do it concerning every revealed truth, ſince he rejects, or at leaſt will not own the diſtinction of truths into <hi>fundamental</hi> and not <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental.</hi> All theſe things conſidered, there can be no certainty that there is any ſure <hi>Tradition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 8. He ſaith, <hi>The ſecond Property belongs to Tradition;</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> 
                     <hi>to wit, it is evidenceable as to its ruling power, to any inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</hi> For, <hi>it is certain, if it be followed, it can convey Chriſts Doctrine down to the Worlds end, as will appear if any conſider, that if Proteſtants have Children, who believe and practiſe as their Fathers brought them up; they will be Proteſtants too, and ſo forward from Generation to Generation.</hi> I anſwer, <hi>Tradition</hi> framed according to a notion which would free it from all the above ſaid imperfections, would be indeed evidenceable as to its ruling power to every capacity: but this is not ſuch a <hi>Tradition</hi> as can be expected to be found in the World. But if any man conſider of ſuch a <hi>Tradition</hi> as is in the World; in caſe he be confident of the true delivery of the ſenſe of the foregoing Generation; yet it will not be evidenceable as to its ruling Power, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:170758:207"/>he can be ſatisfied, that the foregoing Generation did certainly hold the truth, in all points. Perſons who have little knowledge, may poſſibly believe this, without ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it at all doubtful. But they who know how uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the way of <hi>Tradition</hi> is, and what corruption of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was in the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> what Prophecies of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie under the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> and what great defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were reproved in many particular Churches in the Apoſtles times; as the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> and others; will ſee that they can have no other certainty of the former Generation, where their Fore-Fathers lived, being in the right, (unleſs they make uſe of ſome other trial, beſides a knowledge that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſtianity) than an over-weening eſteem of their own Relations, which may be an affectionate, but not a rational ground of perſwaſion: and by this means the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading virtue of <hi>Tradition</hi> may be prevalent, but its ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Power cannot be evidenced. Indeed where there is no better help than <hi>Tradition,</hi> it may lead to error in one place, if it lead to truth in another, and ſo is no where certain; thus it did perſwade the <hi>Heathen</hi> to refuſe <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Fathers delivered other wayes of <hi>Gentile</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: which I ſuppoſe is part of that <hi>vain converſation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Tradition from their Fathers,</hi> mentioned by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18. Yea, God himſelf complains, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.13, 14. <hi>They have forſaken my Law, which I ſet before them, and have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim which their Fathers taught them. Proteſtants</hi> acknowledge the practice or belief of Fore-Fathers, to be a conſiderable Motive to perſwade, either to judge or do as they judged, and did; until by inquiring into the Rule, it ſhall diſcover any error therein, and then it is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined. Yet withal he who underſtands, that his Fore-Fathers did keep to a fixed Rule in preſerved Records, hath thereby the more reaſon to rely on their judgment, as a ſtrong Motive to perſwade him: and this is the caſe of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>§. 9. He proceeds to ſhew, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> 
                     <hi>That the third condition of the</hi> Rule of Faith, <hi>agrees to Tradition; that is, it is apt to juſtifie unreflecting perſons, that they proceed rationally while they rely on it: becauſe it is a madneſs, not to believe a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of knowers, in things they were taught, and practiſed all their lives. Nor can any deceit be ſuſpected in ſuch multitudes, who all agree in a matter of fact, appear to ſpeak ſeriouſly, and practiſe as they ſpeak, eſpecially ſince Parents will be apt to teach their Children things good and true.</hi>

                  <p>I anſwer, Where there are many teſtifiers capable of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving teſtimonies ſurely, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> it would be a madneſs not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a multitude of knowers: but where what evidence they give, ſuppoſeth ſuch innumerable contingencies, which though poſſibly they may all have happened right; yet it is a thouſand times more like they have not this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, is far from any tolerable ſatisfaction. But in the preſent caſe, none can give teſtimony, but only concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt Age; nor concerning that with abſolute cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. They cannot teſtifie what is neceſſary here to be known; to wit, that all Ages were free in every Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from unfaithfulneſs of memory, that they forgat no truth, that they all had right underſtanding to err in none, and a liking of it to imbrace all truth, and a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient care not to add any explications, which might vary from the truth, nor to deliver any thing upon opinion, which they did not certainly know to be truth, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that every Age did commit the whole truth to the next Generation. If any one of theſe fail in any one ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, all ſecurity of their knowledge is gone; and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Generation proceeding upon <hi>Tradition,</hi> cannot teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all this, and therefore cannot be a multitude of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. This way of Tradition muſt therefore ſuppoſe all things right in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but will not prove them ſo. Can there be any likelihood now, of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Oral and <hi>practical Traditions</hi> bringing down truth, ſince before the Flood, where the Succeſſions of Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not many, and many of them lived together, and
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:170758:208"/>had an <hi>Adam</hi> caſt out of Paradiſe, as a viſible token of Gods vengeance, againſt them who were negligent in Religion; yet it is certain there was great corruption at that time? And after the Flood they worſhipped other gods, though they had the argument of the <hi>deluge,</hi> to make them more careful, both to deliver and receive the true Religion: after <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>time,</hi> they had the Motive of the <hi>terrible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and many wonderful judgments; and after <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time, the Argument of the <hi>Captivity,</hi> to make them careful in Religion: and yet in all theſe times they miſcarried.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> (he tells us) <hi>no deceit can be ſuſpected here.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> I anſwer, if there be ſo many waies of failing otherwiſe, what if there be no deſign of deceiving? but indeed it is not a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that there ſhould be a deſigned forſaking the truth in the Church, which in the way of <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> will eventually include deceiving. Is it not poſſible that men who profeſs Religion, may ſo far gratifie the Devil, and their own vain imaginations, as to forſake the truth they know, in great matters of Faith, and to practiſe and live contrary to it, and to promote that which they know is contrary to truth? Elſe what mean ſuch complaints as theſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.9, 10. <hi>A conſpiracy is found amongſt the men of Judah, and among the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem. They are turned back to the iniquity of their fore-fathers, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to hear my words, and they went after other Gods to ſerve them.</hi> Is not a conſpiring to refuſe Gods Word, and to ſerve other Gods, a deſigned rejecting the truth? Yea, I further demand, what account can poſſibly be given of the high corruptions among the <hi>Jews,</hi> all along from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> unleſs a deſigned rejecting the truth? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſuch caſes as theſe. That they who had ſeen Gods wonders in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and had heard the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments delivered on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> ſhould ſay to <hi>Aaron, Ariſe, make us Gods,</hi> Exod. 32.1. If this was not done wilfully, and againſt ſufficient knowledge, then we muſt imagine that they who did ſee the Law given on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> yet knew
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:170758:208"/>not the firſt or ſecond Commandment. Yea, after many ſevere judgments, to ſhew how neceſſary the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Commandments were, yet when they ſerved <hi>Peor</hi> in the Wilderneſs, and joined themſelves to other Gods frequently in the times of the <hi>Judges,</hi> and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Kings of Iſrael;</hi> could this be for want of knowledge, when the Law of God was among them, which would teach them otherwiſe? Yet if this <hi>Authour</hi> ſhall think it was of great ignorance: this will as much deſtroy his way of <hi>Tradition,</hi> ſince it will then follow that there was not ſufficient delivery of truth from hand to hand, to make it knowable. And yet many of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were very general in all the people and Prieſts: and their ſerving <hi>Baalim,</hi> which their Fathers taught them, was of long continuance.</p>
                  <p>§. 10. He aſſerts, by way of Anſwer to an Objection, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> That <hi>men cannot be as much juſtified for believing Scripture; becauſe ſetting aſide Traditions help, this only depends on skills, judgements and fancies; and not on certain ſenſe, either for the meaning or letter of Scripture.</hi> Touching the letter of Scripture, we ſet not aſide the help of <hi>Tradition,</hi> but have a very ſure way of <hi>Traditional Record</hi> to relie on: and I have in former Diſcourſes ſhewed, that we have a certain knowledge of Scripture, both as to letter and ſenſe. Yea, the ſenſe of Scripture is more eaſily diſcovered in many concerning truths, than the ſenſe of <hi>Tradition</hi> can be; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though the words be ſuppoſed equally intelligible, whether written or ſpoken; it is more evident that the words found in Scripture, are ſuch as contain the ſenſe of Scripture, than that ſuch and ſuch words do contain the ſenſe of the <hi>Church Tradition:</hi> Becauſe it is certain that in many concerning points, there are many things deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſeveral in the <hi>Church,</hi> which yet are not by the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> themſelves owned for <hi>Church Traditions;</hi> ſo that it will be hard, if not beyond the reach of the Vulgar, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what words in many points he may doubt of, do truly expreſs the ſenſe of the <hi>Church;</hi> unleſs he can hear
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:170758:209"/>it plainly expreſſed in ſome approved and received Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; ſuch as either <hi>Scriptures, Canons</hi> of <hi>Catholick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> or <hi>Liturgies</hi> or the like: the former as this Authour too much rejects; ſo all or almoſt all his Arguments will as much plead againſt the other, which the Vulgar are not capable of ſearching. Yet that we may compare the evidence to the common apprehenſions of men given by <hi>Scripture,</hi> or by <hi>Oral and practical Tradition;</hi> let us follow him in obſerving which evidence a Jury would ſooneſt cloſe with. The caſe is by him in this §. very unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propounded; <hi>Whether they would condemn a man upon the teſtimony of ſix Witneſſes upon ſight, or upon the judgment or opinion of a thouſand men?</hi> for as we have ſhewed, it is not only skill and opinion, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but delivery of Records: and therefore the caſe in truth ſhould be thus propounded; <hi>Whether if any matter of Fact be inquired of, they would be the more ſwayed, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſeveral perſons, who aſſert, that they have heard many ſay, that they heard many others ſay, that they received from others, and they from others by hearſaies, at the fortieth or fiftieth hand; or by others, who ſhall produce plain Records, and thoſe preſerved ſafe in ſeveral Courts, which all agree in teſtifying it was otherwiſe? Or if the Queſtion be about any Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy, if the one party brings ſuch hearſaies abovementioned, and the other brings a Copy of the Will preſerved in the Court, and evidence that in the ſame manner it was inrolled in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Courts; is it not plain the latter will appear the better Evidence to the common ſenſe of mankind?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in this §. 10. he further adds, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> 
                     <hi>The Vulgar have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, there was ſuch an one as King</hi> James, <hi>or Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>of which they are no otherwiſe aſcertained but by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: but if you pump their common reaſon, about the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Statute Book, you ſhall find them at a loſs.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning King <hi>James,</hi> or Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> they may indeed own them by the common <hi>received Tradition,</hi> becauſe they know this is actually delivered by thoſe who knew it, and that it is not capable of a miſtake, nor could any intereſt
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:170758:209"/>be ſuppoſed to deviſe this, nor can mens conceptions of this vary from what is intended to be delivered: but in none of theſe things can men have ſecurity in the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of many truths by <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> as was obſerved in Anſwer to §. 7. But to put the caſe more like this, of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering which is more juſtifiable, of believing <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Tradition;</hi> I demand, whether as to all conſiderable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, atchievements or conſtitutions under theſe Princes, it be more rational to relie on what appears in common fame, concluding that nothing is conſiderable, which was not there preſerved; or to apply our ſelves to ſome good Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, eſpecially if we could be certain we could find ſuch, as had a certain knowledge of all ſuch things, and had a faithful deſign to commit the truth and nothing elſe to Writing, concerning all theſe things. This ſecurity we have concerning the Scriptures; ſince it is certain the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Evangeliſts did fully know all points of Faith, delivered to the World by Jeſus Chriſt, and did declare them in their Writings with like faithfulneſs. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Vulgars knowledge of the Authority of the <hi>Statute Book;</hi> it is evident that if they hear the <hi>Statute Book</hi> to be publiſhed by ſuch a man, or the <hi>Statutes</hi> by him collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they can thence conclude, that as far as they can be aſſured, that it was his Work, and that he was certainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to collect theſe <hi>Statutes,</hi> and did in this act according to his utmoſt knowledge; ſo far they are aſſured of this Books Authority; as alſo as far as they are aſſured of the faithfulneſs and ability of judgment in them who own it as ſuch. But in all theſe things we have certainty of Scripture, that it was written by the Apoſtles and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, by the <hi>general Tradition</hi> of it as ſuch by all Churches; that they were able and faithful, and their Books faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written, both from our Saviours approving them to diſpenſe his Goſpel, and his Church receiving them as ſuch diſpenſers, even in theſe Writings; and God himſelf bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Witneſs, both with Signs and Wonders, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. So that we are as ſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:170758:210"/>Scripture, as a man could be of the Authority of a <hi>Statute Book,</hi> if he knew there was a collection of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, (as was done by <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s order in the <hi>Civil</hi>) made, approved, and confirmed by order of the Supreme Power; and thereby Enacted, that this Collection ſhould be owned as the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Here it would be a madneſs to doubt. So that this third Property of the Rule of Faith is agreeable to <hi>Scripture,</hi> but not to <hi>Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 11. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> He proceeds to the ſixth Property, <hi>That it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in it ſelf, becauſe this will prove the fourth, fifth and ſeventh.</hi> Now though this be not true, that what is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in its ſelf can ſatisfie the piercing Wits, and convince obſtinate Adverſaries, and be aſcertainable unto us, becauſe there may be a certainty in the thing, which is not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it is not the being, but the evidence of certainty ſubmitted to, that works theſe effects; elſe could there be no diſſatisfaction in any thing, ſince all truth is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it ſelf truth: yet if he can prove the certainty of <hi>Tradition,</hi> I ſhall over and above yield the reſt. This he thus goes about to prove. <hi>Since Faith muſt be certain, and muſt have a certain Rule, he hath</hi> (as he ſaies) <hi>ſhewed that Scripture is not certain, therefore Oral Tradition is.</hi> This looſe Argument deſerves no better anſwer, than that I have ſhewed <hi>Scripture</hi> is certain in it ſelf, therefore <hi>Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is not. Yet I muſt tell him, his Argument is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe faulty, than in ſuppoſing his having proved <hi>Scripture</hi> not certain; for there is ſomething beſides <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is a better guide or leader to the Faith, than the <hi>Oral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and that is the Doctrine of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> as preſerved in the Ancient Fathers, or approved Writers of their time. For though they were men, and might in ſome things miſtake, and therefore their teſtimony is much inferiour to <hi>Scripture;</hi> yet ſince they lived in times near the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and when the vigour of Chriſtian piety was much continued; the Doctrines then received are more like to be truth, than what is now owned in the <hi>Church of
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:170758:210"/>Rome,</hi> after many ſucceſſions of Ages, and great degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of life, even in the dreggs of time. And we have as much and more reaſon, to think theſe men, both capable of knowing Doctrines then delivered as the Faith of Chriſt, and faithful in relating them, as we can have to judge ſo concerning any perſons now in the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> But that there is not an agreement in all conſiderable points, in what was then delivered and owned by the Fathers, and the preſent <hi>Traditions</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from one inſtance I ſhall hereafter mention, <hi>Diſc.</hi> 8. and ſo far as concerns this Author from their <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> which ſhall be diſcuſſed in the end of this Book.</p>
                  <p>§. 12. He would prove the certainty of Tradition, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> in that he ſaith, <hi>It hath for its baſis, the beſt nature in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, man's; and that not in ſpeculations, which may miſtake by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but his eyes and ears, which are neceſſarily ſubject to the operations of nature, and this in moſt; many times every day; which is a much higher certainty, than a ſworn Witneſs hath, of what he ſaw or heard but once.</hi> Theſe upon ſerious inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appear empty vain words. For doth Faith conſiſt only in ſeeing and hearing? Muſt there not be a delivering, and receiving, which ſuppoſeth conceptions and many other acts of the mind? He who conſiders this aright, will find the <hi>haſis</hi> of <hi>Tradition</hi> to be like Fame's baſis; a man clad with all his infirmities, with a memory that may let things ſlip, eſpecially if they be numerous, as revealed truths are; with an underſtanding that may miſtake, eſpecially in things difficult, as many truths are; with affections that may diſreliſh or ſlight them, if corruption prevail, as it may oft do in the members of the Church; with imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations which may alter or add ſomewhat, when they think they only explain; and yet ſtill may they not deliver all they know and remember. In this caſe he who may be certain that he hath heard ſuch and ſuch words delivered, may remain very uncertain, whether they be true or not. And he who is a Witneſs in any Court, may be much more ſure, that what he once ſaw or heard, (if he perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:170758:211"/>it) was ſo heard or ſeen by him; than any man can be of the true relation of things he hath oft heard ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by men, who took them themſelves upon others relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they on others, and ſo on. So that the great imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of <hi>Tradition,</hi> is chiefly as to the delivery of it by former Ages; which this Author doth not ſo much as touch of here, in his proof of its certainty; and what pretenſions he makes uſe of in after Diſcourſes, ſhall be anſwered in their place. But what he ſaith, <hi>That in moſt, many times every day are theſe impreſſions made upon their ſenſes, this may be true concerning ſome Chriſtian truths:</hi> but to aſſert this concerning all truth, is ſuch an apparent falſity, as no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous man could be guilty of. For it is plain that in many things they of the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> cannot agree, which is truth; and have had in many Caſes, Councils and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees to determine what things are matters of Faith; and in many other things they are yet undetermined; which could not be, if theſe things were daily cleared to their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, unleſs they be men of much duller ſenſe, than the reſt of mankind are.</p>
                  <p>§. 13. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> He reminds of what he had ſaid before, §. 8. <hi>That it is as evident, that while the next Age believes and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as the former Age did; they are of the ſame Faith; as it is that to believe the ſame, is to believe the ſame.</hi> But this is not at all to the purpoſe, concerning <hi>Oral Tradition:</hi> only this <hi>Diſcourſer</hi> pleaſeth himſelf generally in ſhifting off, or wholly omitting matters difficult, and ſometimes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to prove what no Adverſary would diſſent in. But there is no certainty in the way of <hi>Tradition,</hi> as we have above ſhewed, that any Age doth in all things believe as the former Age held. See <hi>n.</hi> 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>§. 14. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> He tells his Reader, That <hi>Diſſenters or Doubters can ſay nothing againſt the way of Tradition; not with all the quirks ingenuouſly miſuſed Logick and abuſed into Sophiſtry can furniſh them with.</hi> Indeed what he hath hitherto plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for <hi>Tradition,</hi> hath been nothing elſe but diſingenuouſly abuſed <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Sophiſtry;</hi> but what he now aſſerts, is
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:170758:211"/>a <hi>bold daring</hi> to let his Reader know, that under ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived expreſſions, he will ſtrain to vent any falſhood, though never ſo groſs. Will he ſay that nothing can be ſaid againſt this Rule, when he cannot but know that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who diſſent from it, do ſay very much againſt it? yea, they ſay ſo much as they know can never be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly anſwered. Yea, that we may ſee how little he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns truth in his Diſcourſe, he who here would perſwade his Reader, that nothing can be ſaid againſt his way of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tradition,</hi> yet <hi>Diſc.</hi> 7. §. 1. himſelf tells him of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that ſeems mainly to prejudice it; and ſpends that Diſcourſe in Anſwer. Though indeed much more than that is by us obſerved, againſt <hi>Tradition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He concludes §. 15. from his Diſcourſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> 
                     <hi>that the four laſt conditions of the Rule of Faith agree to Tradition:</hi> but ſince by Trial his Diſcourſe appears very unſound and faulty; I conclude from the detection of his falſhood, that they are not agreeable to <hi>Tradition,</hi> and that <hi>Tradition</hi> is not the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>

HE propounds, <hi>How know we that Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ever held to by any?</hi> and tells us, <hi>he oweth a clearing of this to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Diſcourſe. But,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Proteſtants makes this inquiry needleſs:</hi> for <hi>if they had not faulted the Rule, but only pretended, men had failed it, they might have deluded the World with ſome colour, that they had held to the Doctrine of Anceſtors, and only deſerted us becauſe we deſerted Anceſtors formerly: but if they fault the Rule, they judge Tradition ever ſtood our friend, and would overthrow them,—elſe they had no more efficacious way to ruine us, than to oppoſe us upon thoſe Principles laid in the former Diſcourſe: ſince the renouncers of Tradition a little after the Primitive times (when they pretend we fell) might be eaſily diſcovered.</hi> To anſwer this, its requiſite firſt to underſtand the meaning. Now his inquiry of <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> being held to ever, I conceive, ſignifies thus much: whether every Age hath deſigned the careful receiving, holding and delivering all things owned by the former Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; in the ſame way as they were thence deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and alſo whether they have effectually performed this? And if this could be proved, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> would grant his former Diſcourſe ſatisfactory, ſo far as concerns <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> being the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> The proof of this is highly neceſſary, when he hath to do with <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> becauſe they therefore fault this Rule of <hi>Tradition,</hi> becauſe they
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:170758:212"/>know it ſuch, as cannot be probably expected to be long held to, nor can ever be demonſtrated, or rationally prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been thus held to at any time, unleſs by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to another <hi>Rule of Trial.</hi> Wherefore ſince we know the Rule inſufficient which <hi>Papiſts</hi> relie on; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude not, but with truth and evidence aſſure the World, that we deſert them, only becauſe they have deſerted the Doctrine of <hi>Anceſtors</hi> formerly. Whether this was by miſtake or by perverſeneſs and wilfulneſs, it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for us to know or declare, ſince we do diſcover the difference of their Doctrine from that of their Anceſtors, partly by the writing of Fathers, who ſhew what Doctrine they received; and principally from the teſtimony of the Scriptures, which aſſures us what was the Doctrine in the beginning preached by the Apoſtles. Now when we give evidence, that they have deſerted the Primitive Doctrine; it is a very vain propoſal to require of us to diſcover who were the firſt Renouncers; for though ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have done ſomewhat to this purpoſe, and ſome Renouncers may be manifeſted; yet ſince neither <hi>Proteſtants</hi> nor <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> can know all particular deſigns or actings of men in former Generations; and whatever may be known by Hiſtory, upon the Principles of this <hi>Diſcourſer,</hi> muſt not be believed; eſpecially ſince this is neither the only way, nor the beſt way to ſhew Primitive Doctrines diſowned; I may well conclude, that the propoſal it ſelf, is both needleſs and unreaſonable. Will this <hi>Authour</hi> aſſert that <hi>Gentiliſm</hi> pretended to be held from their Fathers, was a <hi>Tradition</hi> truly derived from <hi>Noah,</hi> unleſs the perſon or perſons can be named to him, who were the firſt deſerters of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Doctrine? or muſt the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> be owned as the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> until the <hi>Authours</hi> of the firſt corruptions of thoſe <hi>Traditions</hi> can be found out? or could not our Saviour and his Apoſtles, condemn ſuch <hi>Traditions,</hi> unleſs they firſt declared the Authors of them? Doth he think it would be reaſon or madneſs, if a temperate man in a ſick ſtate, ſhould ſay to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:170758:213"/>his Phyſician, I am ſure I was in health, and have indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to keep my body in the ſame good temper I was in; and therefore until I can have evidence given me, what time and by what act my Diſtemper began, I will not be perſwaded but that I am ſtill in health. Or if an houſe that was once firm and ſtrong, now is cracked, or decaied or burnt down; can this be no otherwiſe ſatisfactorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, than by examining when the firſt crack or beginning of decay was occaſioned, and by what means, and when it was ſet on fire, and by whom? And ſhall he who ſees this houſe ready to moulder down, or in its aſhes, think it reaſonable to deny or doubt that it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decaied or burnt, if he cannot be ſatisfied in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer inquiries? I know <hi>Papiſts</hi> have generally more wit than to act upon ſuch reaſonings as theſe, in purchaſing ſuch houſes; and therefore I have the more reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that they do not mean honeſtly in urging ſuch frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things in concernments of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Yet this <hi>Diſcourſer</hi> further deludes his Reader, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we pretend they fell a little after the Primitive times; by which he interprets himſelf to mean, times, which had a vicinity to the Apoſtles; as if <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did indeed grant, that <hi>Popery</hi> as it now is, was held and practiſed ever ſince a little after the Apoſtles: whereas this Diſcourſer cannot but know, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do generally aſſert, that though ſome corruptions might creep into the <hi>Church,</hi> ſoon after the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> daies, yet in the chief points of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> we do aſſert that for the firſt ſix hundred Years; the genuine Writings of the <hi>Fathers</hi> do favour the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> aſſertions, and in many things very long after, and therefore that thoſe <hi>Popiſh</hi> aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are of later original.</p>
                  <p>§. 3, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 4, 5. He tells us, <hi>That ſuch is Gods goodneſs, that the</hi> Rule of Faith <hi>hath that in it, which obligeth the generality not to deſert it. That Tradition is actually indefectible,</hi> he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to demonſtrate <hi>à priori,</hi> from proper Cauſes, and <hi>à poſteriori</hi> from a now-a-daies experienced effect. His
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:170758:213"/>grounds for the former are theſe. <hi>Firſt, the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was at firſt unanimouſly ſetled in the hearts of great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, in ſeveral parts of the World. Secondly, this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was by all thoſe, believed to be the way to Heaven, and the deſerting it the way to damnation: whence the greateſt hopes and fears imaginable, ingaged them to adhere to it. Thirdly, hopes and fears ſtrongly applied, are cauſes of actual will. Laſtly, this was feaſible, the things were knowable, and within their power. Therefore from Age to Age a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber would continue to hold themſelves, and teach their Children, as themſelves had been taught; that is, would follow and ſtick to Tradition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I now come to examine theſe four grounds. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt there was indeed Chriſtian Doctrine firmly ſetled in multitudes, and very great numbers; that is, ſo much of the Chriſtian Doctrine, as was requiſite for them to know, or all the great and moſt neceſſary Chriſtian truths: but that all matters of Faith, or all Divine truth declared by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, was firmly fetled in all the faithful, can never be proved. Yea, evident it is, that among the moſt eminent Fathers, who lived not long after the Apoſtles daies, there are acknowledged ſome errors, and they were not alone in them, but had many parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and followers: <hi>Cyprian</hi> erred about <hi>re-baptizing; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin Martyr, Papias, Irenaeus, Lactantius,</hi> and others, were in the <hi>error</hi> of the <hi>Chiliaſts;</hi> and many other erroneous opinions were in ſome of the forementioned Authors, and in <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and much more in <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Origen.</hi> So that though this ground (if the others all hold) may help us to know the great points of Religion, yet it can be no ſecurity to all the truths of God, from the multitude of Believers. The ſecond ground is of the time nature with the former, which concerns only the chief truths of Religion, in the generality of Chriſtians. For the faithful could not while free from error, believe this which is an error, that the want of underſtanding any truth of God, was the way to damnation: for <hi>S. Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="408" facs="tcp:170758:214"/>ſaith expreſly, that they muſt <hi>receive the weak in the faith,</hi> and <hi>God hath received him, and God is able to make him ſtand,</hi> Rom. 14.1, 3, 4. So that though they did know the great truths of Chriſtian Faith neceſſary to Salvation, and therefore would diligently learn them and teach them; and though they did know that the denial or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of any truth, which they had evidence was of God, was likewiſe dreadfully dangerous, which would ingage them to hold faſt all the truth they had received, upon account of the higheſt hopes and fears fet before them; yet would not the ſame inforcements lie upon them, to ſhew the neceſſity, either of their own knowing, or of their Children being inſtructed in all manner of truths: ſince there were Myſteries and ſtrong meat for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and milk for the weak. Yet I alſo aſſert, that as there were many perſons of eminent knowledge in the myſteries of the Goſpel, in the Apoſtles daies, who had great <hi>gifts</hi> of <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>interpretation;</hi> by the teaching of theſe men if it was diligently heeded, all Divine truth might poſſibly be received by ſome others in the next Generation, who had capacities of underſtanding them; but I have no reaſon to judge that theſe were multitudes. And the love of God, and his truth, would excite all the faithful (as they had opportunity) both to indeavour to know all truth of God, and alſo firmly to receive and declare it; but this will not free them from all ignorance, or capacity of erring.</p>
                  <p>The third ground is many waies imperfect, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to the proof of the caſe in hand; for <hi>firſt,</hi> it is not enough to prove <hi>Tradition indefectible,</hi> to know that fears and hopes when ſtrongly applied will have this effect; but we muſt know that in all Ages they were thus ſtrongly applied to the generality of teſtifiers, or to the greateſt number of the <hi>Church viſible:</hi> but alas! how evident is it that in all Ages, the cauſes of hope and fear, have not been ſo applied by very great numbers in the Church, that they ſhould take due care of their ſouls by a holy life? And
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:170758:214"/>ſince the Devil oft deſigns the perverting the Doctrine of Chriſt; as well as corrupting the practice of Chriſtians, and they who reject a good Conſcience, are in a ready way to make ſhipwrack of the Faith, what poſſible ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can be given, that thoſe Motives, hopes and fears, are a firm ſecurity to preſerve Doctrine? <hi>Secondly,</hi> though it is not to be doubted, but that many pious men would be affected with ſuch hopes and fears, who had this Doctrine delivered to them; yet conſidering that ſuch pious men if conſidered as Fore-Fathers, might have careleſs and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Children; or as Prieſts and Teachers, might have care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and irreligious Succeſſors; there muſt needs appear very great danger, that in any family or place, this <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> will not be in every Age faithfully continued, by the prevalency of ſuch hopes and fears. Nor is this only a Notion, ſince it is certain that a very great part of the Chriſtian Church, did in the Primitive times entertain the <hi>Arian Hereſie,</hi> and promoted it, and taught it to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And ſince it is evident, that groſs ignorance and ſenſuality hath reigned in ſome Ages more late, among the generality both of Clergy and People in the <hi>Romiſh Church:</hi> there can be from this ground no rational ſecurity given, that any great part of the deliverers were conſcientiouſly careful, to deliver faithfully, according to what they had received, becauſe it appears they did not act, as men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon by ſuch hopes and fears would do.</p>
                  <p>His laſt ground likewiſe is unſound: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> for in the way of <hi>Tradition,</hi> all Divine truth cannot be evidenced to be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; not only becauſe (as is aboveſaid) much may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivered by the truly faithful, and much perverſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the corrupt, and much miſtaken: but even that alſo which in the way of <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> is delivered by the beſt deliverers, cannot in all things be clearly diſcovered to be a ſufficient <hi>Tradition.</hi> For <hi>firſt,</hi> we cannot know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the beſt deliverers now in the World in this Oral way, do deliver ſufficiently that which was by the former Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to them declared: for this muſt either be in a
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:170758:215"/>form of words received from the Apoſtles, or without ſuch a form: if they deliver the Apoſtles very words, it cannot be doubted, but then the ſenſe intended by the Apoſtles is as fully delivered as the Apoſtles themſelves delivered it; ſince the ſame words muſt needs ſignifie the ſame things. But they who reject the way of Scripture-delivery, as the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> pretend not to any ſuch form of words which ſhould contain all truth. But a delivery without a form of words, is only a delivery of what is conceived, judged, or apprehended to be the ſenſe of the former Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; and this is a way liable to error, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies on the skill of every Generation; or the way of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thoughts and conceptions of all theſe truths; and likewiſe upon a skill of fully expreſſing ſuch conceptions in words after they are rightly framed in the mind; and both theſe parts of art muſt be ſecured in the moſt exact manner, to every ſucceſſion of deliverers. Now as it is not certain, that in all Ages there hath been a readineſs of full expreſſion of what they conceived to be truth; ſo for certain Controverſies and Diſputes, they ſhew in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, that mens apprehenſions are not unerrable. <hi>Secondly,</hi> if it had been certain, that ſome in the late paſt Generations, did deliver all truths fully; yet in the way of <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> it cannot be known evidently who they are, and which is that true <hi>Tradition:</hi> for all men acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Church Hiſtory know, that when there have been differences amongſt great Doctors of the Church in their delivery, this hath ſometimes occaſioned the calling of Councils to determine them, and declare which is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be held in the Church, as about the Religious uſe of <hi>Images,</hi> in the <hi>eighth Century,</hi> and many other caſes. Now before the determination of ſuch a <hi>Council,</hi> it is not evident which are the true deliverers, from the way of <hi>Tradition,</hi> ſince both parties contend for their own deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and no other Rule of Trial muſt be admitted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Diſcourſer, but <hi>delivery</hi> or <hi>Tradition:</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the former conſiderations it appears, that the beſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:170758:215"/>may be the feweſt. And this may be as uncertain after a <hi>Council,</hi> ſince there is nothing elſe to aſcertain us; but the vote of a major part, which in many <hi>Councils,</hi> hath certainly been the worſer part, and maintained <hi>Hereſie;</hi> and therefore ſo it may be in others, where there can be no evidence given to the contrary. And by <hi>Determinations</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> the leſſer part and their Adherents, are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to reject their way of delivery, and receive the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and by this means the leſſer number, which may be in the truth, muſt diſclaim their own ſenſe and judgment, to ſubmit to the judgment of others, which may be in the wrong, and ſo the true <hi>Tradition</hi> may be loſt.</p>
                  <p>Yet that it may appear more evident, how vain the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to demonſtration in this Diſcourſe is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> I ſhall applie his way of demonſtrating, to ſome other <hi>caſes,</hi> which it will fit as well as <hi>Romiſh Tradition.</hi> It is certain that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Moſes,</hi> the true Doctrine was diſperſed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and after <hi>Noah,</hi> who was a Preacher of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs amongſt his Sons: they had the greateſt hopes and fears to ingage them to this truth, and theſe are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of actual will, and the <hi>truths</hi> are knowable; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both <hi>Gentile Tradition</hi> from <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> from <hi>Moſes,</hi> were indefectible, according to this Diſcourſer's Principles; and ſo the true Religion may at this time be found, either among <hi>Gentiles</hi> or <hi>Jews.</hi> Yea, it was certain, that Gods will was declared to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in Paradiſe, and to the <hi>Angels</hi> that fell, before their fall; and they had the greateſt hopes and fears, to perſwade them to keep to this will of God; knowing that obeying it, was their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and deſerting it their ruine: theſe hopes and fears are the cauſes of actual will, and the duties themſelves both knowable and practicable, and they had no corrupt inclinations to ſway them; therefore according to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrator, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and all the <hi>Angels,</hi> did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their obedience. The ſame way of demonſtration would prove that never any <hi>Hereſies</hi> could either be broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or by many be received in the Chriſtian Church:
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:170758:216"/>But in theſe caſes, who ſees not that it will be anſwered, that either the truths of God declared, were not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently heeded, or elſe the cauſes of hope and fear were not ſufficiently applied, and at all times acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and obſerved; and that in ſuch caſes there was a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption either in belief or in practice: but then every eye will ſee, that this might as well be imagined in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church,</hi> as in any other company of men. So that he hath made it as clear, that the <hi>Romiſh Tradition</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defectible, as that the <hi>Gentile</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh Traditions</hi> were, and are; and as certain as it is, that there is no <hi>Devil</hi> or <hi>fallen Angel,</hi> and no <hi>fall</hi> of man, and conſequently no <hi>ſin</hi> in the World, and no <hi>Hereſie</hi> ever in the Chriſtian Church. But here it is needful to do this Authour that right, as to obſerve his unuſual modeſty, that he intitles this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe not a demonſtration, but an indeavouring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> He ſpeaketh to this purpoſe. <hi>If any ſhall object, Original Corruption indiſpoſeth Parents wills; ſince Chriſts Doctrine was intended to be an Antidote for that Original malice; to ſay it is univerſally applied, and preſerves none good, is to queſtion Chriſts wiſdom: and many thouſands, Martyrs and Confeſſors, did hereby overcome the declivity of their wills. Again, nature cannot incline all to this ſort of ſin, to teach their Children what they think will damn them, but moſt ſtrongly carries them to the contrary.</hi> To this I may in the firſt place obſerve, that neglects of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might be, if there had been no Original corruption; as was in <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and in the <hi>Angels,</hi> where was no antecedent ſinful inclination, but they were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly capable of ſinning. Yet I aſſert, there is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by Original corruption, and its prevalency both as to the Will and Underſtanding. Now <hi>Chriſts</hi> Doctrine is indeed a poiſe or Antidote againſt this, yet this is <hi>firſt,</hi> where this Doctrine is carefully entertained and retained, but not ſo, that there ſhould be no fear of its being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in any Church. S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not nouriſh needleſs
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:170758:216"/>fears for his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who had this Doctrine, leſt <hi>their minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt:</hi> nor were they untrue complaints of his <hi>Galatians,</hi> Chap. 3.1. <hi>Who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth?</hi> And we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> can diſcern nothing to ſhew that this Doctrine muſt needs be otherwiſe a poiſe in the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> than in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> or <hi>Galatian. Secondly,</hi> where this Doctrine is retained, it is a poiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Original corruption</hi> in a conſiderable degree, yet not ſo as to remove all imperfections proceeding from Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, which may hinder right delivery of all truth: for though in ſome excellent perſons there be a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to deliver truth; yet there may be ſome miſtake even in holy Martyrs and Confeſſors. The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> as well as <hi>we,</hi> own <hi>Cyprian</hi> as a <hi>Saint</hi> and <hi>Martyr,</hi> and yet acknowledge him to have erred, and moſt <hi>Africans</hi> then with him in delivering that they who were Baptized by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> ought to be rebaptized; ſo that in following good men, there may be miſtake: but they are more like to err, if they be bad, as many certainly are. But concerning his laſt clauſes, it is no way neceſſary to ſuppoſe, that to <hi>invalidate Tradition, Parents muſt deſign to teach Children what they think will damn them:</hi> we ſuppoſe very many may deſign truth and good, who yet may be in error; yet there may be others who through prevalency of corruption in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, may deſign to corrupt the truth, and may teach their Children ſo; and all this out of that Principle that prevails with men to wicked lives, which is not a deſign to damn themſelves, but a deſign to gratifie their evil affections. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17, ſpeaks of many who <hi>corrupt the word of God;</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi> foretells of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>who ſhall bring in damnable Hereſies,</hi> and we know the <hi>Jews</hi> did teach their Children to worſhip <hi>Baalim:</hi> moſt probably this was not out of deſign to damn them: however we know no demonſtrations to prove that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> have higher affections to their Children naturally.
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:170758:217"/>than <hi>Jews</hi> had; or that when there is danger of truth being corrupted in the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> they of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> ſhould be exempted from liableneſs to that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>§. 7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> He thus proceeds; <hi>If any object, the fickle nature of the will;</hi> (he anſwers) <hi>Good is the object of the will. Now infinite goods and harms ſufficiently propoſed, are incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more powerfal cauſes to carry the will, than temporal ones: therefore a world of Believers cannot be willing to do that which would loſe them and their Poſterities infinite goods, and bring them infinite harms.</hi> To this I anſwer; That if this be ſpoken of the generality of profeſſed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, theſe words would ſtill as much plead againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> fall, and the corruptions of <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> as againſt defection in the <hi>Romiſh Church;</hi> ſince all theſe had the greateſt goods and harms propoſed to them. But I further anſwer; That a conſiderable number in former Ages, would indeavour to know and deliver ttuth aright, but they ſtill are liable to miſtakes, and others that hear them, to miſunderſtandings; and alſo it is poſſible, that the ſubtilty of ſome Deceivers may take place, and be received ſooner than their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of truth, by which means thoſe truths may many of them be loſt or perverted; and even in theſe laſt Ages I doubt not but even in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who would deſire good, and love truth (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they have diſcerned it, many have forſaken the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> way; but they who moſt deſire to find it, can in the way of <hi>Tradition,</hi> ſee no more than is there to be ſeen: and if others by ſubtilty corrupt ſome of that; it is not in the power of theſe honeſt meaning perſons, to hinder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of ſuch corruptions, if they be promoted by a more potent party and intereſt.</p>
                  <p>§. 8. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> If any think the propoſal of Senſible Objects, <hi>more conſiderable than of Spiritual, he indeavoureth to ſhew the excellent propoſal of the truths of God, and thereby evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth they may be applied.</hi> This doth not much concern
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:170758:217"/>Proteſtants. we acknowledge that there is nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to the propoſal of Gods truth, but yet there was in many, neglect of receiving what was ſufficiently propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whence followed all the abovementioned miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And even God himſelf propounded his truths as he thought moſt meet; that is, he propoſed ſuch as were not ſo neceſſary for all to know, more myſteriouſly, whence many might be ignorant of them, or miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend: but other neceſſary truths he propounded with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant evidence and plainneſs. But in the preſent way of <hi>Tradition,</hi> what this Authour obſerves, to make the propoſal evident, is very imperfect; <hi>for though they have obvious Metaphors, daily Practices, Language and Actions, Sacraments and Ceremonies:</hi> yet theſe things may them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves partake of corruptions, and then may help to clear what is propounded, that ſomewhat may be underſtood; but not withal to ſecure that this is certainly from God, and therefore is Divine truth: Nor do moſt of theſe things reach all truth to be delivered, nor ſecure from all miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, ſo far as they are intended to ſignifie truth, in ſuch matters as are more difficult and myſterious.</p>

The caſe of <hi>Tradition</hi> and Propagation are wonderfully different alſo, in that he who hath the nature of man in him by Propagation, cannot alter this nature, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of another nature at his own pleaſure; whereas it is very poſſible for ſuch as have imbraced the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine, to forſake it, and fall aſide into <hi>Hereſies,</hi> as hath been oft evidenced in the World: and alſo in that thoſe particular perſons in mankind, who do not propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate their kind, are not capable at their pleaſure, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating any thing different from man: but in the way of Chriſtian Faith, they who do not propagate the true Faith, may, and many of them do propagate error, and that ſo ſubtilly, that very many are oft deluded by it.

                  <p>I ſhall here ſhew in what he criminates <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to be falſe; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> but before I come to anſwer on the behalf of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to the things here charged on them, and the <hi>ſelf-contradictions</hi> pretended, (for though he talks of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi> in this Diſcourſe, it is eaſie to obſerve his only aim is not at <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but at <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that is, at truly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Chriſtians</hi>) I ſhall obſerve, that what he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in this Paragraph, is a very effectual way to ſhew <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> no <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> nor ſo much as a probable way to diſcern <hi>truth:</hi> for if they who deſert <hi>Tradition</hi> or Doctrines delivered by it, may require their Children to guide themſelves by their ſenſe: if this be poſſible, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is, and this <hi>Diſcourſer</hi> here aſſerts as much: it can never be demonſtrated that this hath not been the practice of the preſent <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> and that many things now delivered as truths in their way of <hi>Tradition;</hi> were not <hi>Hereſies</hi> or <hi>errors,</hi> broached by ſome mens fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in a former <hi>Generation,</hi> who required their Children to follow their ſenſe. Yea, beſides this, if it be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral way of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> (as this Authour here aſſerts) to promote their Heretical tenets in the way of <hi>Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it will be beyond the skill of this Authour, (unleſs he ſhall retract this deſcription of <hi>Hereſie</hi>) to give the leaſt aſſurance to any reaſonable men, that the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which goes on in the way of <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> is not upon this account of <hi>Tradition,</hi> to be much ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of holding <hi>Hereſies.</hi> Yea, it will hence alſo the more effectually follow, that it is impoſſible that <hi>Hereticks</hi> ſhould be diſcerned from the holders of the true Faith, if there were no other Rule to diſcover this, but <hi>Oral Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> ſince this Diſcourſer aſſerts, that this very Rule, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> generally cloſe with, in the propagation of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> at a diſtance from its firſt original. Yea, and it will

See both his §. 3. and §. 5.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer now to this 3. §. that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do not at all throw aſide the <hi>Scripture Letters Self-ſufficiency</hi> as a Rule. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> I ſuppoſe this <hi>Diſcourſer</hi> cannot be ignorant, that while we own <hi>Scripture</hi> a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> we acknowledge the neceſſary and principal Doctrines thereof, to be ſo clear and intelligible in Scripture, that they may without actual error be comprized in ſome form of ſound words; ſuch as are <hi>Creeds, Confeſſions of Faith, Articles, Catechiſms,</hi> or the like: and we do acknowledge and aſſert theſe truths, even ſo many as are neceſſary to the Salvation of all the <hi>adult</hi> in the Church, to be infallibly evident to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and underſtandings of men, from the fulneſs and plainneſs of their propoſal in Scripture. <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will require Children to receive ſuch things as theſe, as certain truths, from the Paſtors or Parents, not becauſe they are from their Fathers or Teachers, but becauſe they are things certainly by them diſcerned to be in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: and till theſe Children are able to ſearch and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the ſame themſelves, their Parents or Teachers knowledge is a very conſiderable Motive to them to own ſuch truths as clear in Scripture. And this is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as certain, as they are capable of, until they come themſelves to peruſe and underſtand the Scripture; yea, it is certain enough to them to command their aſſent, as certain as other things are, which credible perſons atteſt upon their eye-ſight. For in what I plainly diſcern, I as ſurely know that I read ſuch a Poſition in a Book, as that I hear or ſee other things in converſe in the world. Now ſince what is thus delivered by <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is ſo delivered, becauſe it appears to be the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Doctrine; this is an eſtabliſhing and holding to, not a rejecting and throwing by the Scripture as a Rule.
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:170758:222"/>But while we own Scripture as a Rule, there is no more reaſon why <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould tolerate men to contradict what is plainly and evidently deducible from Scripture, under pretence of holding to it as a Rule; than there is that in a caſe of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> one who is to indeavour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the <hi>rebellion,</hi> ſhould be ſuffered to aſſault the <hi>King,</hi> when he plainly appears to be the <hi>King,</hi> under pretence that he took him to be a <hi>Rebel.</hi> Yet as to matters not fully clear in Scripture, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do allow differences of Opinion, if managed peaceably; and that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that we are not violent proſecutors of our own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, only becauſe they are ſo: the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England</hi> condemn nothing for <hi>Hereſie,</hi> but that which was ſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by one of the <hi>four firſt General Councils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what he intimates of <hi>obliging to act, that is,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> 
                     <hi>(if with good conſcience) to hold as themſelves do;</hi> makes me think he deſigns chiefly to reflect upon <hi>prudential conſtitutions,</hi> ſuch as are amongſt us, the <hi>Oaths of Obedience</hi> and <hi>Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and matters of <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Conformity.</hi> But in none of theſe things do <hi>Proteſtants</hi> deſert this Principle of Scripture being the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> For Proteſtants who hold this aſſertion, never intended to exclude the uſe of prudenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Rules and Conſtitutions, for the advantage both of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Societies; but ſuch Conſtitutions they neither own nor preſs as matters of Faith, nor as Gods Commands in themſelves neceſſary to ſalvation. In this caſe, if Proteſtant Rulers oblige to nothing as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential, orderly, and decent, but what they are well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that it is lawful according to Gods word, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereunto, and for other ends expedient, and not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly burthenſome, (which appears the common caſe of all <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi>) they no way ſwerve from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Rule. Yea, if here any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Rulers ſhould err, and urge as lawful, decent and prudential, what is indeed ſinful and evil; in this caſe they ſin, and practically ſwerve from the true Rule, as men do in all acts of ſin and miſtakes of judgement; but they do in no wiſe intentional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:170758:223"/>diſown this Rule of Scripture; ſince they hold faſt this as a firm Principle, that if any thing which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be practiſed as lawful, can be fully manifeſted to be againſt Scripture, they will rather reject that Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, than oppoſe the Scripture, and will acknowledge that their Subjects ought to obey the Scripture rather than ſuch commands.</p>
                  <p>But he tells us, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> That theſe <hi>Diſſenters (from Proteſtants) do guide themſelves, to their beſt capacity by the Scriptures Letter, which is the Rule their perſecutors (Proteſtants) who puniſh them</hi> (for not obeying) <hi>taught them, and made uſe of themſelves when they brake from the</hi> (Romiſh) <hi>Church.</hi> I anſwer, 1. It is much to be feared, that many who diſſent from the <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi> in theſe matters pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential, do not act according to their beſt capacities; but ſome from <hi>paſſion</hi> and <hi>ſelf-will,</hi> ſome from the <hi>applauſe</hi> of a <hi>party;</hi> others from <hi>pride,</hi> and a <hi>ſinful reſolution</hi> not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own what they once unadviſedly and erroneouſly took up. 2. Yet I doubt not, but very many who diſſent from the prudential Rules of the <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi> or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> do act according to the beſt light they have of Scripture truth; yet have they not the ſame reaſons and grounds to juſtifie them, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> have to juſtifie themſelves in departing from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;</hi> for we rejected <hi>Popery,</hi> not only becauſe we could not diſcern whether it was <hi>lawful</hi> or not by the Scripture-Rule; but becauſe in matters plain in Scripture, we did clearly diſcern it <hi>ſinful</hi> by clear Scripture-evidence, which plain evidence <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the <hi>Church of England</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have; nor can they pretend it, unleſs it be <hi>raſhly</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>paſſion,</hi> or <hi>preconceived prejudice.</hi> But for thoſe who act according to the beſt light they have from Scripture, which will ſuppoſe them willing to be better informed, we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> no way diſlike, but highly approve of their Rule, and of them for deſigning to follow it, ſo far as we can diſcern ſuch perſons. And as the <hi>Proteſtant Doctrine</hi> aſſerts, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation, are plain in
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:170758:223"/>Scripture; ſo we doubt not but theſe perſons, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who according to their beſt capacities cloſe with the Faith there delivered, and practiſe the duties there requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, are in the way to ſalvation, nor can they err in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters fundamental. But ſtill they may err in ſome other matters, and particularly about the lawfulneſs of ſome things prudential; nor did Proteſtants ever aſſert, that they who deſigned to follow Scripture to the beſt of their light, could in nothing be ſubject to error, where they have not a diſcovery of clear evidence, which in all things all inquirers may poſſibly not attain. Yet I muſt further declare, that if this deſign, of following Scripture accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mens beſt capacity were more followed, and all <hi>paſſions, prejudices,</hi> and unchriſtian <hi>ſuſpicions</hi> laid aſide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> the number of them who diſſent from the <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi> upon the beſt light of Scripture they have, would in a ſhort time be reduced to a very few. 3. Where in any caſe, ſuch perſons as theſe are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is not for deſigning to follow Scripture, but for not obeying ſome prudential lawful commands, in a caſe where their miſtake is the cauſe of their not obeying; not is it any more a condemning their deſign to follow Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, than in Civil <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> when any one is impleaded in a <hi>Court,</hi> becauſe he for want of <hi>good Counſel,</hi> acts what he by miſtake thinks to be according to <hi>Law;</hi> but is caſt as not having acted according to the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Judge</hi> ſhould be thought to puniſh this man unjuſtly, becauſe he deſigned obedience to the <hi>Law;</hi> yea, to puniſh him for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning this obedience to the <hi>Law.</hi> Some ſuch inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as theſe, are like to be in <hi>Civil</hi> things, while men are liable to miſtakes, and ſomething is capable of being miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: but theſe things concern not at all the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> or the rejecting the Scripture from being the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From what hath been ſaid, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> it is eaſie to vindicate the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> from the following <hi>ſelf-contradictions,</hi> he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon <hi>Hereticks.</hi> The firſt of which is to <hi>reform upon
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:170758:224"/>pretence of Scriptures Letter being the Rule; and afterwards in practice to deſert that Rule, in their carriage towards others.</hi> This Rule <hi>Proteſtants</hi> deſert not, ſince they propound no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be aſſented to by any as a matter of Faith, but what they judge certainly evident in Scripture; nor require they any thing to be practiſed as orderly, but what they diſcern or judge not contrary to Scripture. 2. Nor do we diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to others the <hi>grounds our ſelves proceed upon:</hi> for we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to all, and commend in all, their practice upon clear and well grounded Scripture-evidence, but we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther allow our ſelves, nor others, to practiſe upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded pretences of Scripture being on our ſide. The <hi>Third</hi> pretended contradiction is, <hi>To pretend firſt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures Letter clear of it ſelf, without needing the Church to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it, and afterwards to judge the followers of it to their beſt power to go wrong; that is, to confeſs it obſcure, and to need their new Church's interpretation.</hi> But <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that in all <hi>neceſſary</hi> Doctrines the evidence of <hi>Scripture</hi> is ſo clear, that it needs no interpretation; nor can they be denied, but by preferring intereſt, paſſion, or ſome other ſond conceptions above <hi>evidence;</hi> and this is to forſake <hi>Scripture:</hi> but in many other things they who do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> may err, though they follow it to their beſt power; but notwithſtanding this, Scripture is ſufficiently clear in the <hi>evidence</hi> it gives of all Divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed truth, to them who do diſcern its <hi>evidence;</hi> though men be confeſſed to be men; and many of them not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of full underſtanding many truths. His <hi>Fourth</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction charged on <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but deſigned for <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> is, that they <hi>perſecute others, for taking that way, which they held (at leaſt pretended) meritorious in themſelves:</hi> in which charge, as the thing intended is palpably falſe concerning <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſo the language he uſeth agreeth not to them. The <hi>Fifth</hi> pretended contradiction is, to oblige others to relinquiſh <hi>the ſole guidance of Scriptures Letter, and to rule themſelves by their Tradition; and at the ſame time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Catholicks, to impugn Tradition as unfit to ſenſe it, and
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:170758:224"/>abet only the ſelf-ſufficiency of Scriptures Letter.</hi> The former clauſe here charged on <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> is no way their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; for though in matters <hi>prudential,</hi> they require in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours to be ruled by the commands of their Superiours; which both <hi>Scripture</hi> and the <hi>Government</hi> of all <hi>Societies</hi> in the World require; yet in matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> they require that men receive them only from <hi>Scripture</hi> as the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> or the main ground of belief. Nor are any <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> in any caſe commanded to relinquiſh <hi>Scripture</hi> as a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> and to rule themſelves by <hi>Tradition,</hi> more than if in a <hi>Corporation,</hi> a member who cannot read, hath his duty read to him by another out of the <hi>Charter,</hi> or told him in words, with great care collected out of the <hi>Charter,</hi> to expreſs its ſenſe; this ſhould be called a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding this man as a member of this Society to relinquiſh the ſole guidance of the <hi>Charter</hi> as his Rule, and to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by others <hi>Tradition,</hi> when he follows the <hi>Charter</hi> by the beſt evidence he hath concerning it, and relies not on a delivery of continued hearſaies, report, and fame, which is a way ſuitable to the <hi>Romiſh Oral Tradition.</hi> As to the latter part of this pretended Contradiction, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the impugning <hi>Tradition</hi> as unfit to ſenſe Scripture; if this be underſtood of the preſent way of <hi>Romiſh Oral Tradition,</hi> this indeed we do ſo impugn. But if this be underſtood of the <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Primitive Tradition:</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do acknowledge this ſo far as it can be manifeſted to be general, to be very fit to ſenſe ſuch Scriptures as are otherwiſe difficult, and obſcure; and ſo far as we have any intimations of ſuch <hi>Traditions,</hi> by the Ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> we own them uſeful.</p>
                  <p>The laſt pretended contradiction is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> To <hi>impute that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage as a fault to our</hi> (Romiſh) <hi>Church, which themſelves practice; and which is moſt material, our Church puniſhes none but thoſe who deſert our Rule, but they puniſh for too cloſe following their Rule.</hi> All the clauſes of this charge, are guilty of deſerting the Rule of Truth. For <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who fault this <hi>Traditionary way,</hi> do not practiſe this <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                     <pb n="430" facs="tcp:170758:225"/>as hath been above ſhewed: nor do <hi>Proteſtants</hi> puniſh any for following Scripture too cloſe, as hath been evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced. The middle clauſe is likewiſe untrue: for if he mean, that the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> never puniſheth any, who pretend to hold to the <hi>Tradition</hi> they received, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the beſt of their knowledge; how came it to paſs that <hi>Victor</hi> excommunicated all the <hi>Aſian Churches,</hi> for not keeping <hi>Eaſter</hi> the ſame day with the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> though theſe <hi>Aſian Churches</hi> pleaded a certain <hi>Tradition,</hi> not only from their famous <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but from <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Deacon,</hi> and his <hi>Daughters,</hi> which were <hi>Propheteſſes,</hi> and from S. <hi>John the Apoſtle and Evangeliſt? Euſ. Hiſt. Eccl.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 24. Yea, how came Mr. <hi>White</hi> to be cenſured at <hi>Rome,</hi> who thought he defended the Rule of <hi>Tradition?</hi> yea, how came <hi>Monſieur Arnold</hi> to be ſo troubled by the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> even for the uſing thoſe words which he received from S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> a famous and approved <hi>Father?</hi> But if he only mean that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> puniſheth none, but ſuch as ſwerve ſome way from the <hi>Traditions</hi> ſhe delivers, this, if true in it ſelf, is nothing that can truly be called moſt material; it being neither pertinent to his charge againſt <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> nor conſiderable in it ſelf, ſince it only ſpeaks the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> commendable, in not puniſhing thoſe, who believe every thing it ſaies, and practiſe every thing it commands: and was there ever any Society in the World, that in this thing was not as commendable as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome?</hi> But when he here tells us, their <hi>Church</hi> puniſheth none but thoſe, who deſert the Rule ſhe recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, ſurely he much forgat himſelf §. 5. where ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Hereticks, he ſaith that the deſerters of the natural way of <hi>Tradition,</hi> have been but few, and the Deſcendents of theſe Revolters followed <hi>Tradition:</hi> for either he muſt ſay, that their <hi>Church</hi> puniſheth no Deſcendents of Revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as he calls them; that is, allows all <hi>Hereſies</hi> in any but the firſt Authours of them; or elſe muſt acknowledge that it puniſheth them whom himſelf accounts (and there, as he thinks, proves that they are) not deſerters of <hi>Tradition.</hi>

                  <p>§. 4. He asks, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> 
                     <hi>What can follow hence, but that Subjects, whom common ſenſe cannot but make exceeding ſenſible of ſuch unreaſonable carriage, in perſecuting them purely for following Gods word, which themſelves had taught them, they ought in conſcience to follow; ſhould ſtrive to wreak their malice againſt their Perſecutors, and to involve whole Nations in War, and Blood:</hi> but he after adds, <hi>he intends not a juſtification of thoſe revolting Sects.</hi> But it cannot be that common ſenſe, nor any rational evidence, ſhould teach Subjects under <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes,</hi> that they are perſecuted purely for follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods Word; ſince there is no ſuch thing in truth, they can no otherwiſe think it is ſo, but by evident miſtakes, or by ſuch deluding perſwaſions, as this Authour would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them with.

Whence amongſt the Primitive Chriſtians, where the Laws of their Perſecutors commanded them the worſhip of a Deity, and yet puniſhed them for worſhipping the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and Chriſt his Son, with the holy Spirit, which is the only God, and the Chriſtians knew there was none elſe: and puniſhed them for not worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping as Gods, them whom they knew were no gods; yet in this caſe, the Chriſtian Principles which the Scripture delivers, kept them in all loyal ſubjection to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours. If this Principle of making Scripture every

                  <p>To the 2. <hi>Qu.</hi> I anſwer, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That in the Church of God which ever held theſe points, <hi>Fathers</hi> did teach their <hi>Children</hi> theſe Doctrines, yet were they not only nor chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued by the way of <hi>Oral Tradition.</hi> For the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive</hi> Chriſtians made Scripture their Rule, as ſhall be after ſhewed, from their Writings; and <hi>Fathers</hi> taught <hi>Children</hi> chiefly then, by what they read and received by the writings of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And the Children of theſe Parents had not only their Parents teaching, but they had alſo the Scriptures read among them, and peruſed by them, and by this means in the <hi>Primitive times</hi> were theſe Doctrines continued. That the <hi>Apoſtolical Doctrine</hi> was continued in the <hi>Church,</hi> chiefly from the <hi>Scriptures, Irenaeus</hi> teſtifies, even of thoſe Primitive times. <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus Haereſ. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 63. The Doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles is the true knowledge, which is come even unto us, being kept without fiction by the moſt full handling of the Scriptures.

Yea, ſuch was the eſteem of the uſe of Scripture, that in the Primitive times, before their Children were taught matters of human literature, they were inſtructed in the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:170758:227"/>holy Scriptures. Thus was <hi>Origen</hi> brought up; <hi>Euſ. Hiſt.

                  <p>To his 3. <hi>Qu.</hi> Were it certain that theſe truths had been preſerved by the way of <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> only, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in the true Church of God, (as indeed they have not been) yet this is not by any ſuch virtue in the way of Tradition, as would ſecure the right delivery of all other things. For this is wholly contingent in reſpect of <hi>Tradition,</hi> depending upon this ſuppoſal, that in ſuch a Society, it hath alwaies been rightly delivered, and rightly received; which is a contingency; and notwithſtanding the virtue of <hi>Tradition</hi> might have been otherwiſe, as appeared in the <hi>Eaſtern Churches</hi> under <hi>Arianiſm:</hi> Yea, the reaſon why theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are preſerved intire among the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly this, that as they have been and are delivered by them from the Scriptures, they are alſo delivered in certain forms of words; and in thoſe Creeds which were received from thoſe Ancient <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> who were not erroneous, but agreed to the Scripture. Now whereas their <hi>Tradition</hi> directs to receive what hath been deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the things delivered have been ſome by <hi>Councils</hi> truly <hi>Catholick,</hi> and other things by erroneous <hi>Councils;</hi> it may well be that <hi>Tradition</hi> may in ſome things deliver rightly; and yet either omit the delivery of other things, or deliver them amiſs. And if there had been nothing more, to have preſerved theſe Doctrines in the <hi>Weſtern Church,</hi> but what was in the neceſſary virtue of <hi>Tradition,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church</hi> (not here to mention any thing of <hi>Arian Popes</hi>) might have loſt theſe points as well as the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> long ſince did, where <hi>Tradition</hi> loſt this virtue of preſerving them.</p>
                  <p>Now that it may appear how vainly this Diſcourſer would conclude the certainty of <hi>Tradition,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> from the things propounded in theſe <hi>Queries;</hi> I ſhall mention ſome paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:170758:228"/>Caſes, to which the ſubſtance of what is here queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, may be applied. As, 1. Concerning <hi>Gentiliſm.</hi> To follow this Authour, I would ask, was not the Belief of a God, and what things we agree in, conſtantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by <hi>Tradition</hi> among them? now by what virtue did <hi>Tradition</hi> perform this? may we not by the ſame virtue of <hi>Tradition,</hi> receive what they delivered concerning the way of Gods Worſhip? and would not this <hi>Tradition</hi> as well have continued all other things, if any ſuch had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered? Thus it would plead for <hi>Gentiliſm.</hi> 2. How would this plead for <hi>Judaiſm.</hi> Did not <hi>Tradition</hi> amongſt them continue till Chriſts time, the Doctrine of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, of the Sabbath, of Sacrifices, and of a Meſſias? and muſt they not needs be in the right, in all other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of delivery, though they were condemned by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. 3. See how theſe <hi>Queries</hi> would plead againſt all poſſibility of forgetfulneſs. When I have read a Book over, and am certain I rightly remember ſome clauſes in it, may I thence conclude, that by the ſame virtue of memory, I remember theſe, I ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred all other clauſes, if there had been any? and therefore certainly there was no more in the Book than I can remember. Or if I ſhould conclude, that becauſe I am certain, that I remember ſome paſſages which happened when I was a Child; therefore by the ſame virtue that theſe things were delivered to my memory, I alſo remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber aright all things then done: who would not ſee that this is a meer vain piece of <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> ſince ſome things may be more fully underſtood than others, and more heedfully obſerved, the impreſſion upon many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions more deeply imprinted, and the remembrance of them more frequently repeated? whence ſome things may be remembered, and others not; and the ſame cauſes may be aſſigned in matters of Religion.</p>
                  <p>To his 4. <hi>Qu.</hi> I anſwer, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Things may be received as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered ever, when yet there was no ever-delivery which I will manifeſt in anſwer to the following §. where he would prove the contrary.</p>

                  <p>§. 3. He layes down this effect, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 
                     <hi>The preſent perſwaſion of Catholicks, that their Faith hath deſcended from Chriſt and his Apoſtles uninterruptedly; which muſt for its Cauſe, have Traditions Ever-Indeficiency.</hi> §. 4. To prove this, he layes his firſt Principle, <hi>That Age which holds Faith ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, cannot change, nor know any change of it; becauſe no man, much leſs a whole Age, can hold contrary to knowledge, nor here change without knowledge.</hi> To this I anſwer, That ſuppoſing the abovementioned perſwaſion, this may riſe from other cauſes, beſides <hi>Traditions indefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency:</hi> Yea, this his firſt Principle to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is very weak. For, <hi>firſt,</hi> it is very eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that miſtaken Explications of Points of Faith may be held by a preſent Generation as having been matters of Faith, <hi>ever delivered,</hi> and yet may be really different from the things delivered, and ſo include a change. This is the more apt to take place, if ſuch expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated points ſeem plauſibly declared, and are either abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by men of great fame, or ſerve an intereſt: and this is as poſſible as it is for men to be deceived in their conceptions about things not in expreſs terms delivered: ſince it is certain that many points now owned as matters of Faith in the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> were not expreſly and in ſuch terms delivered of old: yea, this Authour acknowledgeth as much, <hi>p.</hi> 206, 207. Many ſuch explicated points have in <hi>Councils</hi> been declared to be <hi>de fide,</hi> though not only againſt the minds of many who before aſſerted the contrary, but of others who in the ſaid <hi>Councils</hi> oppoſed it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Doctrine as from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> where they change or know ſome change of it, is much more probable in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> than in others; if any ignorance poſſeſs the Leaders, or any intereſt and private deſigns take place upon ſome few of them. For ſince the <hi>Tradition</hi> which particular perſons have received, muſt ſubmit to the determination of a <hi>Council<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> or elſe muſt they be anathematized, how eaſie is it
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:170758:229"/>for ſome point <hi>de fide,</hi> to be innovated; if the <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> and ſome few other men of note and fame, through miſtaken zeal, or out of deſign, ſhould indeavour the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch a Point declared as a matter of Faith, when he can ſend what <hi>Biſhops</hi> he pleaſe, or create new ones, and many others may for want of circumſpection, comply in order to peace, as ſome well diſpoſed Biſhops did unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly with ſome of the <hi>Arian</hi> devices. And in this caſe, though there may be ſome withſtanders, yet may they not be numerous, and therefore muſt ſit ſtill being overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erred, and will think they ought in the end to conſent, if they have received this Principle, which many <hi>Papiſts</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace. That the determinations of ſuch a <hi>Council,</hi> are to determine their private judgments, what is the Doctrine of the Church.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. His ſecond Principle is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 
                     <hi>No Age could innovate any thing, and deliver that thing as received by conſtant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. For the end of delivering it as ſo received, muſt be to make the following Generation believe it. Now if a whole Age ſhould conſpire to tell ſuch a lie, yet it is impoſſible it ſhould be believed, ſince they cannot blot out all Monuments which might undeceive; and therefore the following Generation cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, unleſs they will believe what they know to be otherwiſe.</hi> This Second Principle is unſound, upon the ſame grounds with the other. For as hath been now ſhewed, there may happen ſuch an innovation, by the miſtake or non-atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of a conſiderable number, eſpecially in <hi>Councils,</hi> who ſometimes are too readily guided by ſome few emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent leading men, who may act either out of miſtake, or ſome of them out of deſign; and by theſe men, if in an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and confirmed <hi>Council,</hi> both the preſent and future Generation muſt be determined. But what he ſpeaks of a future Generation eaſily diſcovering the <hi>innovation,</hi> makes me think he forgets himſelf. For how ſhould the following Generation of <hi>Catholicks</hi> conſiſtently with this Authours Principles, diſcover it? By former <hi>Monuments?</hi> But he in this Book declares, that they muſt not give heed
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:170758:229"/>to any former private mens Writings, againſt the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> publickly atteſted. And if any publick Writing, though it be their own approved <hi>Canons,</hi> ſeem contrary; they muſt find ſuch interpretation as will agree with this declared Doctrine, and ſtick to it, though it be wreſted; ſo that whatſoever can be ſhewed from Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Ancient <hi>Doctors,</hi> (as this Authour declares in his <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollaries</hi>) is to ſuch <hi>Papiſts</hi> of no account againſt <hi>preſent Tradition.</hi> See <hi>Coroll.</hi> 14.16, 17. Yea, if you ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a great number of oppoſers, as may in many caſes ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be done, he will hold to the greater number in his preſent Council. If you produce him a former <hi>Council</hi> againſt any now received <hi>Doctrine,</hi> he muſt not rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge of the <hi>Tradition,</hi> but from the preſent <hi>Tradition,</hi> condemn that, if it cannot be otherwiſe interpreted, as <hi>Heretical.</hi> If you produce the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> or <hi>Graecian,</hi> or other Churches, as delivering otherwiſe; if this cannot by other means be evaded, they muſt not be acknowledged by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> for true Deliverers. But if we can produce an <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved General Council;</hi> have we not now ſuch ſufficient Monuments to diſcover thereby what was the Doctrine of the Church: ſuch Councils our Diſcourſer calls the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Authority in the <hi>Catholick Church, p.</hi> 129. Yet if the Council was approved, and by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged both for Catholick and General, ſtill they have a device to reject what ever diſlikes them in ſuch a <hi>Council,</hi> by ſaying, that it is <hi>ex parte approbatum,</hi> and <hi>ex parte reprobatum;</hi> or, part of it rejected, and part of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: by this device they reject part of the <hi>Second Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council at</hi> Conſtantinople, and the <hi>Twenty eighth Canon of the Fourth General Council</hi> at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which declares, that their Fathers gave Priviledges to the See of <hi>old Rome,</hi> becauſe that was the <hi>Imperial City;</hi> and therefore upon the ſame conſideration, they gave the ſame Priviledges to the See of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> And thus they have rejected others of old; as alſo part of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Baſil</hi> more lately, concerning the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:170758:230"/>and Power of the <hi>General Councils</hi> over the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus doth <hi>Binius</hi> and other <hi>Papiſts.</hi> So that no way remains for a <hi>Papiſt</hi> thus principled, to detect this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation where he hath contrary evidence: much leſs in many caſes, where the matter now determined, hath not been ſo diſtinctly of old treated of: ſo that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> may innovate, and yet expect to be believed that the Doctrine was ever delivered. Provided, they take care not ſo palpably to contradict their own publick and former delivery, in ſuch a way as no poſſible interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can make things conſiſt one with the other. If they do take this care, there is room enough left, for many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations in Doctrine, in points not clearly enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined formerly, in the publick Monuments of that <hi>Church;</hi> and in thoſe alſo by miſinterpretations. But though <hi>Papiſts</hi> conſiſtently with their Principles, can make no diſcovery of Innovations, but muſt either make uſe of ſtrained interpretations of former Writers, or elſe muſt condemn thoſe Writers; yet <hi>Proteſtants</hi> can, and do make this diſcovery. And bleſſed be God that they of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church,</hi> have not ſo blotted out the Writings of the Ancient Fathers, (though they have ſhewed ſome good will thereto) nor have they been able ſo to correct the Letter of the Scripture, according to their own ſenſe, (as this Authour thinks convenient <hi>Cor.</hi> 29.) but that we are able from them to diſcover the <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> of the <hi>preſent Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> of which in the cloſe of this Diſcourſe, I will give him one inſtance.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. From theſe Principles he concludes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> 
                     <hi>That ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new could be owned, as not new in any Generation (by the firſt), nor a foregoing Age make it received as not new by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity by the ſecond; therefore ſince we hold it deſcended unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptedly, it did deſcend as ſuch.</hi> To this I anſwer; That if the former Principles had been both true, as neither of them are; yet would not this concluſion have followed from them, becauſe it ſuppoſeth beſides theſe Principles, many other things to be true, which are either very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:170758:230"/>or certainly falſe. <hi>Firſt,</hi> it ſuppoſeth that all points held as matters of Faith, have in all Ages ſince Chriſt, been delivered in ſuch terms, as <hi>ever delivered-points</hi> of Faith, whereby they have been known diſtinctly from diſputable opinions: if this had been ſo, the many Controverſies, whether ſuch and ſuch things were <hi>de fide,</hi> ſhew the maintainers of them on the one ſide, not capable of underſtanding plain words. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it ſuppoſeth that nothing can be received as <hi>ever delivered,</hi> by a following Generation, which was not delivered as ever received in a former Generation, unleſs they declare ſomething not to be new, which they know is new. For why may not that which is propounded as a <hi>probable opinion</hi> in one Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be thought to be delivered as a <hi>truth</hi> in the next Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and in ſome following Generations (who cannot give an Hiſtorical account, how far in every Age, every Poſition was received) it may be owned as a point of Faith; by which means alſo Conſtitutions of expediency, may be owned as Doctrines neceſſary. In which caſe they now only hold as a matter of Faith, what the former Generation held as a truth, and ſo they hold no new thing differing in the ſubſtance from the former, nor deſign they any thing new in the Mode of holding it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that every Generation from the time of the Apoſtles, have been of the opinion this Authour pretends to, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to hold all, and nothing but what the immediately foregoing Generation held, which is a point can never be proved. For this would be indeed to aſſert, that never any perſons ſtudied to underſtand any point more clearly than it was comprized in the words they received from their Fathers; or elſe that when they had ſo ſtudied, they never declared their conceptions, or opinions in ſuch points; or if they did declare them, yet no number of men would ever entertain them. And this is as much as to ſay, that the <hi>Church</hi> never had any <hi>Doctors</hi> ſtudied in the points of Faith; or at leaſt, that ſuch ſtudies never were honoured in the <hi>Church,</hi> and the fruits of them received and applauded by
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:170758:231"/>it; which if it would not caſt a great indignity upon the <hi>Church,</hi> yet it is apparently contrary to the truth. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It ſuppoſeth, but proves not, that all points of Faith have come down by the way of <hi>Tradition,</hi> and none of them fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of being delivered. For if any one of theſe be falſe, as doubtleſs they are, his demonſtration falls with them.</p>
                  <p>But that we may further ſee the virtue of this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> it may be obſerved, that he who will ſuffer-him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be perſwaded by theſe vain reaſonings, may with as much reaſon be a <hi>Jew,</hi> or a <hi>Pagan,</hi> as a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> The <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Doctrine held forth by their <hi>Talmud,</hi> as alſo the former Doctrines of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> were believed by that people to be <hi>delivered ever</hi> from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Ezra;</hi> here is an effect like this, of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> perſwaſion; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in no Age could it be changed, but was <hi>ever deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and therefore true; if the <hi>Romiſh Tradition</hi> be upon theſe grounds ſufficiently proved <hi>indefectible.</hi> Amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Opinions of <hi>Jupiter, Juno, Mars,</hi> &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gods, was believed to have been <hi>ever delivered</hi> to them from ſome Divine Revelation of its Original, for elſe they could never have believed them to have been gods. Now ſince it is certain the <hi>Gentiles</hi> received this by <hi>Tradition</hi> from their Fathers, and the firſt Generations of mankind after <hi>Noah,</hi> were undoubtedly inſtructed in the truth concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, of which <hi>Noah</hi> was a Preacher of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance amongſt them: ſince according to this Diſcourſer, no Age could deceive them in delivering what it knew falſe, or in delivering for certain, what it knew was not certain: Yea, ſince the <hi>Tradition</hi> of <hi>Gentile Polytheiſm</hi> was more general, than the <hi>Popiſh Tradition;</hi> that is, it was received and delivered amongſt more Nations, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by fewer perſons, than the <hi>Romiſh Doctrines</hi> were, and therefore if <hi>Tradition</hi> be demonſtrated to be <hi>indefecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> by this Argument for the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> it muſt be alſo for the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Yet this belief amongſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm,</hi> neceſſarily ſuppoſed a failing of <hi>Tradition</hi> in this
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:170758:231"/>great point, that there is one only <hi>God,</hi> So far is it from proving that their <hi>Tradition</hi> could not fail.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now in the cloſe of this Diſcourſe, as I promiſed <hi>n.</hi> 8. give an inſtance of a Point, in which there is an Innovation in the preſent <hi>Oral</hi> and <hi>Practical Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which is, in denying the <hi>Cup</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to the <hi>Communicants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The preſent <hi>Tradition</hi> and practice of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is, that the <hi>Laity</hi> and the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who do not conſecrate, do receive only in one <hi>ſpecies,</hi> to wit, that of Bread; and this they declare to be lawful, (and the contrary not to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or commanded of God) and to be ordered upon juſt cauſes, to be a true receiving the Sacrament, and to be the way whereby they may receive whole Chriſt: and they condemn, yea, and Anathematize any who ſhall ſpeak the contrary, as may be ſeen, <hi>Concil. Conſtanc. Seſ.</hi> 13. and <hi>Conc. Trid. Seſ.</hi> 5. Now both thoſe <hi>Councils</hi> do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that Chriſt did inſtitute, and the <hi>ancient Church</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, this <hi>Sacrament</hi> under both kinds; and therefore by their own acknowledgement, they keep not in practice to what was delivered. But the Queſtion is, Whether their preſent practice and Doctrinal delivery oppoſeth any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer delivery of Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Now that I may lay a good foundatipn, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> and ſuch as no <hi>Romaniſt</hi> will reject, to know what was once the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and delivered Doctrine in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf not to any private Father, though approved, which poſſibly he will except againſt, as not a ſufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifier of <hi>Tradition:</hi> but to ſuch a conſtitution of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as is ſtill acknowledged, to have been an approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Canon,</hi> and therefore the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which is this of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> the Firſt: <hi>We have found that ſome having received only a portion of the holy Body, do abſtain from the Cup of the conſecrated Blood, who (becauſe I know not by what ſuperſtition they are taught to be bound up) muſt without doubt, either receive the whole Sacrament, or be kept back from the whole; becauſe the diviſion of one and the ſame
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:170758:232"/>Myſtery, cannot come without great Sacriledge.</hi> This is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for an approved Canon by all <hi>Papiſts. Ivo</hi> placed it in the beginning of his <hi>Decretum. Gratian</hi> inſerted it, <hi>De Conſecratione Diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>c. comperimus.</hi> It is owned by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine de Euchariſtia, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 26. by <hi>Baronius ad Ann.</hi> 496. <hi>n.</hi> 20. and <hi>Binnius in Vit. Gelaſii.</hi> Nor is it denied by any that I know. And whereas the preſent <hi>Tradition</hi> aſſerts that it is not neceſſary the Laity and Clergy, not Conſecrating, ſhould receive in both kinds; this old <hi>Tradition</hi> ſaies plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they who receive not both kinds, muſt receive neither, it being one and the ſame Myſtery or Sacrament. And though there are ſome Cauſes now declared juſt and rational, to order that, the Communion ſhall be only in one kind, and the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Conſtance (ubi ſupra)</hi> condemn thoſe who call this practice Sacrilegious: yet it is poſſible the ſame reaſons might move ſome in <hi>Gelaſius</hi> his time, to receive only in that one kind; but what ever the reaſon was, he declared it could never be approved, and its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple was Superſtition, and in practice there could never be a diviſion in this one and the ſame Sacrament, without great Sacriledge.</p>
                  <p>Now though theſe words are very plain, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> yet there are two waies the <hi>Papiſts</hi> make uſe of, to pervert the ſenſe of them, which I ſhall diſcover to be vain and frivolous anſwers, and ſo vindicate this teſtimony. The firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that this <hi>Canon</hi> refers to the Prieſts not the Laity. This is the interpretation in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> of <hi>Gratian,</hi> and is mentioned as probable by <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> But, 1. Theſe words of the <hi>Canon</hi> are generally ſpoken by <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> ſo as to include the <hi>Laity,</hi> and with no colour of reaſon can they be reſtrained to the <hi>Clergy;</hi> and ſpeaking of them whom he would have driven back, or kept back from the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and of them who are taught; the ordinary receivers are plainly included, if not chiefly intended: and finding fault with this, that ſome abſtained, reaſon will evince that all are faulted who did ſo abſtain. 2. The reſtraining this to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> is contrary to the Hiſtory and general practice
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:170758:232"/>of thoſe times: it being certain and confeſſed, that even in the <hi>Weſtern Church,</hi> not only till that time, but for ſome hundreds of years after, this Sacrament was adminiſtred to all in both kinds. In this caſe, to conclude, that when ſome were found to abſtain from one kind, they muſt be ſuppoſed to be of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> would be a vain ſurmiſe. 3. This anſwer accordeth not with the Doctrine of thoſe ancient times, which owned the <hi>Laity,</hi> to have the ſame right, to receive in both kinds with the <hi>Clergy.</hi> Thus <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> who was owned as Saint and Father at <hi>Rome. Hom.</hi> 18. in 2. <hi>Ep. Corinth. There is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſomething wherein there is no difference betwixt the Prieſts and the People, to wit, as to the receiving the dreadful Myſteries, for we have all alike right to partake of them. Not as it was under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Prieſt did eat ſome things, and the people other things; and it was not lawful for the people to partake of thoſe things, of which the Prieſt did partake. But it is not ſo now. The ſame Body is appointed for all, and the ſame Cup.</hi> So far S. <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> 4. Though this interpretation reſtraining it to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> contrary to Reaſon, Hiſtory, and the Doctrine of that time, ſhould be allowed; yet would not this be enough to reconcile it with the preſent <hi>Tradition,</hi> which delivers that the <hi>Clergy</hi> alſo, if they do not conſecrate, muſt not receive in both kinds. 5. This firſt anſwer is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged frivolous, from ſome of the grounds above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and rejected by many of the more learned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts: and <hi>Baronius, ad annum</hi> 496. <hi>n.</hi> 20. calls it <hi>frigidam ſolutionem,</hi> a cold or dull ſolution; but pretends to give a better, which now follows.</p>
                  <p>The other Anſwer neceſſary to be examined is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> That this Canon refers to the <hi>Manichees;</hi> and that it was only their receiving in one kind, which <hi>Gelaſius</hi> condemns as Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of whom it is thus written in <hi>Leo his fourth Sermon for</hi> Lent. <hi>When they dare to be preſent at our Myſteries, to conceal their Infidelity, they ſo order themſelves at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Sacraments, that ſometimes they receive the Body of Chriſt with their unworthy mouth, that they may the more
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:170758:233"/>ſafely be concealed; but they altogether decline to drink of the Blood of our Redemption, which we therefore certifie your holineſs, that this ſort of men may be known of us by theſe tokens; and that when their Sacrilegious diſſembling is diſcovered, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marked and detected, may be driven by the Prieſtly Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, from the Saints ſociety.</hi> That to theſe, the words of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> refer, is the anſwer of <hi>Baronius, ad an.</hi> 496. <hi>n.</hi> 21. <hi>Binnius</hi> in <hi>Vit. Gelaſii,</hi> and this alſo is approved by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Nor can any here make a third reply, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> upon any rational ground, that it then was Sacrilegious to have adminiſtred

For this anſwer will not agree with the intent of theſe words, and the Doctrine formerly received in the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> The reaſon why <hi>Gelaſius</hi> declared it great ſacriledge, to take this Sacrament in one kind alone, is intimated ſufficiently in this <hi>Canon</hi> not to refer to the <hi>Churches</hi> Conſtitution, but the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> Inſtitution, in that he calls both ſpecies or kinds one and the ſame Myſterie: and ſayes this one and the ſame Myſterie cannot be divided, without grand ſacriledge; which is to referr us to the nature of the thing it ſelf, and its Inſtitution, as being not mutable. Yea further, the ancient <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> held as a Point of Doctrine, that the <hi>Elements</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> ought to be adminiſtred, according to what Chriſt inſtituted; that is, the Bread and Wine to be given to the <hi>Laity</hi> diſtinctly and ſeparately, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave them ſo; then cannot this third Reply reconcile the preſent Doctrine of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> with what was formerly delivered. To ſhew this, I could produce many teſtimonies; but ſhall only inſtance in <hi>Julius</hi> a <hi>Roman Biſhop</hi> in a <hi>Canonical Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> recorded alſo in <hi>Gratian de Conſecrat.

For it is read in the truth of the Goſpel,</hi> Jeſus took Bread, and the Cup, and having bleſſed it, gave it to his Diſciples. <hi>But for that they gave the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt dipped to the people, they have received no teſtimony pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of the Goſpel, in which he commends to us his body and his blood; for the commendation is rehearſed ſeparately of the Bread, and ſeparately of the Cup.</hi> In which words he makes Chriſts Inſtitution a Rule, by which he condemns
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:170758:235"/>other practices different from it; and from this Inſtitution he requires, that both the Bread and the Cup be ſeparately given; and this even with reference to the Laity, or as he ſpeaks to the people to whom it was delivered: and by this Rule he condemned the giving the Bread dipped in Wine, whereas both ſhould be given aſunder: ſo doth <hi>Gelaſius</hi> by the ſame, condemn the receiving only in one kind, when it ſhould be received in both. All this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, the former <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> may from this inſtance, appear to condemn the late <hi>Tradition</hi> as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious; and therefore I may conclude, that the ſame <hi>Tradition</hi> hath not been alwayes kept to, as may appear by preſerved Monuments, out of which inſtances may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily multiplied.</p>

<pb n="452" facs="tcp:170758:236"/>of the teſtifiers equal, much greater multitudes in divers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, were teſtifiers of Chriſts Doctrine, being converted by powerful Miracles, than the few witneſſes of</hi> Mahomets <hi>exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence: it is eaſier for thoſe few</hi> Syrians <hi>or</hi> Arabians, <hi>to conſpire to a lye, than for theſe Chriſtians: nor can Chriſtians be ſo eaſily miſtaken concerning Chriſtian Doctrine.</hi> In anſwer to this, I in the firſt place grant, That there is an Hiſtorical Traditionary certainty amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> concerning the exiſtence of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and it is very reaſonable, that rather more ſhould be allowed to the <hi>Tradition</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> than of <hi>Mahometans.</hi> But that it may truly appear how far <hi>Tradition</hi> may be relyed on, for the conveyance of truth, we muſt diſtinctly conſider the matters delivered. Of which ſome things there are, which are not probably capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of miſtake, nor liable to be perverted, and to receive a mixture of much falſhood: and have this advantage, that the delivery of them from one to another, doth ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue: and no intereſt perſwades the generality of men to deny, or indeavour the concealing of them. Now all theſe properties agree to the aſſertion of <hi>Mahomets</hi> exiſtence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> to the delivery of the Being of a God among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> being the great Prophet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to <hi>Jeſus</hi> being the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and I may add S <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. being his Apoſtles among the Chriſtians; thus the fame of a good or true Writer may be continued amongſt <hi>Hiſtorians;</hi> and in theſe things and many other ſuch like; I will grant it is not only poſſible, but probable that <hi>Tradition</hi> may convey a certainty. But there are other things lyable to miſtake, whence in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matters of common fame, ſufficiently known to the firſt Relater, by the miſapprehenſion of them who hear the relation, the ordinary report is oft-times falſe; or elſe, 2. They are ſubject to be perverted, or are concealed, and not delivered; which hath been the caſe of many great and famous actions in the world, which are now buried in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, or upon miſinformation condemned; but would have been honourably eſteemed, if they had been truly
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:170758:236"/>known. And here the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Turks,</hi> concerning the precepts of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which were liable to miſtake, would probably have been loſt, if they had not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in a written <hi>Alcoran.</hi> And the Traditional evidence of this very <hi>Alcoran</hi> containing his Doctrine, is much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the <hi>Tradition</hi> of Chriſtians, for the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Doctrine of Chriſt: for even from the beginning of the reception of the <hi>Turkiſh Alcoran,</hi> their <hi>Tradition</hi> hath not procured it ſo full approbation, but that the <hi>Perſians</hi> who profeſs themſelves <hi>Mahometans,</hi> deliver another <hi>Alcoran,</hi> different from that of the <hi>Turks;</hi> which they declare to contain the true precepts of <hi>Mahomet:</hi> whereas Primitive Chriſtians have as with one mouth all acknowledged, that the Scriptures of the Prophets, Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, contain the Doctrine of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> written by Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
                  <p>Now to apply all this to the Doctrine of Chriſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It is certain, 1. that many things delivered by him, are capable of miſunderſtanding, and not ſo eaſily intelligible as <hi>Mahomets</hi> exiſtence is; which is evidenced by the many miſtakes in all Ages, and diſputes amongſt true <hi>Catholick</hi> Chriſtians as well as <hi>Papiſts,</hi> about Doctrines of Religion. 2. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt is likewiſe lyable to be perverted; thus as in the time of the Old Teſtament, the precepts of God were much corrupted by the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who made void the Commandments of God by their <hi>Traditions;</hi> ſo under the New Teſtament, have many <hi>Hereticks</hi> grosſly perverted this truth, and many extravagant <hi>Opinioniſts,</hi> have ſtrangely blended it with their own miſconcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; whence many errors are gone forth into the world. 3. Nor can it be proved that in the way of <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> conſidered without Scripture, all things delivered by Chriſt, are continued in the Church: for ſince in the multitude of Chriſts words, not written by the Apoſtles or Evangeliſts, the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> cannot ſay, that her Tradition hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved any, how can the certainty of this Tradition be reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:170758:237"/>imagined ſo great, as to ſecure a preſervation of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Doctrine? Now let us again obſerve, that all theſe Conſiderations have the greater advantage againſt the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of <hi>Tradition,</hi> by conſidering with them the many ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of Generations; for matters of Faith if but once a little miſtaken in one Generation, ſince they muſt with theſe miſtakes be delivered to the next Generation, they may then be more miſtaken; and ſo by degrees very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable miſtakes, and great corruptions may come in in points of Faith: and as to omiſſion of delivery of ſome truth, if it be continued in ſeveral Generations, yet if it be not impoſſible, that any one Generation as to any truth, ſhould neglect the delivery; it will in ſo many ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be very probable that ſome one hath failed. But in the way of Scripture evidence, the words are the ſame which were then delivered, and the ſame words are no more capable of miſtakes and corruptions in Doctrine, than they were at the firſt, nor are they leſs delivered to us now, than they then were. I may now infer from what is aboveſaid, that the belief of <hi>Mahomets</hi> exiſtence may be continued by <hi>Tradition,</hi> and yet it may not preſerve the whole Body of Chriſts Doctrine.</p>

<pb n="455" facs="tcp:170758:237"/>and ſpread corruptions of Chriſtian Doctrine by their falſe delivery, than ever they could corrupt and ſpread any corruptions of the Scripture-writing.</p>
                  <p>§. 5, 6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> We will touch of the advantages ſuperadded to nature. <hi>It is natural for every man to ſpeak truth, unleſs ſome deſign hinder; but true Chriſtian hearts are much more fixt to Veracity.</hi> §. 7. <hi>Original corruption leads men to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Veracity, by an undue love of Creatures; but Chriſtianity working an overpowering love of Spiritual good, leaves mans diſpoſition to truth free.</hi> §. 8. <hi>The hopes and fears of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity as much exceed others, as eternity doth a moment, and are ſo held by all: yet other Motives bring down matters of fact truly; as the Reigns of Kings, Wars, Eclipſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but that Chriſtian Motives are more prevalent than all others, appears by conſidering the Martyrs and Perſecutions.</hi> In anſwer to this, I firſt obſerve, that what he hath here laid down as a high ſecurity to the Churches <hi>Tradition,</hi> makes nothing at all ſo much as ſeemingly, for the ſecuring all, or any of its members from miſtakes, and miſapprehenſions; nor for the preſerving the weak from being deluded by others ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. All it ſeems to plead againſt, is, intentional deceiving, without which there may be much error. But yet even this deſign of deceiving, may with many in the Church much prevail, notwithſtanding all indeavoured to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by this Diſcourſer. Where Chriſtianity takes full poſſeſſion in the power of it, it will ingage ſuch men to truth, and the love of Heavenly good, and the minding of Spiritual hopes and fears: but how many are there who profeſs Chriſtianity, who oft ſpeak falſhood, and are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to ſin by undue love of Creatures, and do not guide their lives, according to the hopes and fears Religion ſets before them? Therefore theſe things cannot aſſure us of preſerving men from perverting truth, or neglect of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it, much leſs from ignorance and miſtake. And as in other matters of Hiſtory, many things are delivered amiſs in the common fame, but beſt in the allowed Records, ſo it is alſo in Chriſtianity.</p>

For ſince <hi>Proteſtants</hi> own <hi>Scripture</hi> as an unerrable guide, if it pronounce <hi>Tradition</hi> to be the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> then will we acknowledge it to be ſuch: and its reaſonable to expect from <hi>Papiſts</hi> who own the <hi>Scripture</hi> to contain Divine truth, and with the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> own no <hi>Tradition</hi> with greater reverence, than the Scriptures, that if Scriptures declare themſelves to be the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> then this may be generally received. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> if theſe could be generally produced from the Apoſtles times, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will grant, That what is ſo declared to be the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch.

But if ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the Doctrine of the <hi>Ancients</hi> be on our ſide, then <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> will further evidently appear to be no <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> yea, not only to be fallible, but falſe and ſelf-incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, if that which is now delivered concerning it, be contradicted by the conſent of the <hi>Ancient Church.</hi>

                        <hi>That the</hi> Rule of Faith, <hi>is ſelf-evident, from</hi> Iſai. 35.8. <hi>This ſhall be to you a direct way,</hi> ſo <hi>that fools cannot err in it.</hi> Which words as cited by this <hi>Author,</hi> ſhew only the knowledge of God under the Goſpel, to be ſo clear and evident, that they who will ſeek after him and live to him, though of low ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, may underſtand ſo much as is requiſite for their right walking; which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> aſſert alſo, and own this evidence to be in Scripture.</p>
                     <p>But that <hi>Tradition</hi> may be proved this <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> by Scripture, he alledgeth <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.21. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                        <hi>This is my Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord, my Spirit which is in thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart from thy mouth, and from the mouth of thy ſeed, and from the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, from henceforth for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, 1. to have Gods Word and Spirit in their mouth, proves their delivery not a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> or unerring: then muſt the ſpeeches of every private Chriſtian who ſhall be ſaved, be a <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> becauſe the Scriptures aſſure us, <hi>That every one who ſhall be ſaved, hath both the Spirit of Chriſt and his word in their mouth,</hi> ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.32. 2. Though all who are born of God ſhall have his word in their mouth, this will not ſecure us, that what is by any Society of men declared as truth upon <hi>Tradition,</hi> is Gods Word; no more than what the Pſalmiſt ſaies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.30. <hi>The mouth of the righteous ſpeaketh wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and his tongue talketh of judgement</hi>] would aſſure, that the Doctrines owned by the way of <hi>Tradition</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> were alwaies the true Doctrines: ſince it might well
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:170758:245"/>be, that thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> were not ſuch righteous men, as it may alſo be that the generality of ſome <hi>viſible Church</hi> are not Gods ſeed. 3. Gods Word may be in the mouth, where the holy Scriptures are the Rule. We read, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.8. <hi>This Book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ſhalt meditate therein day and night.</hi> Where it is evident, that when <hi>Joſhua</hi> was to keep the Law in his mouth, he had the Book of the Law for his Rule, and had his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Law by meditating in it. God ſaith <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.6. (concerning <hi>Levi</hi>) <hi>The Law of truth was in his mouth,</hi> and Verſ. 7. <hi>they ſhall ſeek the Law at his mouth;</hi> and when they did thus in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time, he read the Law out of the Book of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that Book did <hi>Hilkiah</hi> ſend to <hi>Joſiah.</hi> While S. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſed his Faith with his mouth, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he <hi>believed all things written in the Law and the Prophets</hi> When we read <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.21, 22. <hi>This Song ſhall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their Seed,</hi> verſ. 22. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes therefore wrote this Song the ſame day, and taught it the Children of Iſrael.</hi> Is it not evident, that it was from the writing of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that this Song was in their mouth? and that writing by which they were taught, ſurely was their Rule to know this Song by.</p>
                     <p>Next to this he urgeth as pithy and home, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but not to his purpoſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will give my Law in their bowels, and in their hearts will I write it;</hi> and notes, <hi>that S.</hi> Paul <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinguiſheth the Law of Grace, from</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Law, in that the latter was written in Tables of Stone, and the former in fleſhly tables of mens hearts.</hi> But, 1. What proof is here of <hi>Tradition</hi> being the <hi>Rule of Faith?</hi> Had the Scripture ſaid that under the Goſpel, Chriſtians ſhould receive the Law of God no otherwiſe, than from one anothers hearts, it might have ſeemed to ſerve his purpoſe. S. <hi>Auſtin de Spiritu &amp; litera, c.</hi> 21. having mentioned the place fore-cited of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi> and that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to which this <hi>Diſcourſer</hi> refers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <hi>what are the Laws of God written by God himſelf in their hearts, but the very preſence of the holy Spirit, who is the finger of God, by whom being preſent, Charity which is the fulneſs of
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:170758:245"/>the Law, and the end of the Commandment is poured forth in our hearts?</hi> Now if God cauſeth his commands to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly imbraced by a Spirit of love and piety, this is far from conveying to them a Spirit of <hi>infallibility.</hi> 2. Nor doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> contradiſtinguiſh the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Goſpel in thoſe words, but he contradiſtinguiſheth the way of Gods inward writing in the heart, from the way of his outward writing in thoſe tables. For even the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was alſo written in the hearts of them who feared God, as the Laws of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were more eminently in the hearts of Chriſtians. Hence ſuch expreſſions as theſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. <hi>Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> Pſal. 37.31. <hi>The Law of his God is in his heart, none of his ſteps ſhall ſlide.</hi> Yea, <hi>Moſes</hi> tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> Deut. 30.11. <hi>This Commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far of,</hi> v. 14. <hi>but the word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou maiſt do it.</hi> Yet though Gods Law before the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt was in the hearts of his people, yet was the Book of the Law then their Rule, as now is the Old and New Teſtament. 3. If that place of S. <hi>Paul</hi> be conſidered, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. it will evidence that what the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> going along with his Miniſtry, had written in the fleſhly tables of their hearts, was enough to commend his Apoſtleſhip, which is the ſcope and deſign of that place; but it no ways ſignifies that theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> even at this time, were not capable of erring in any Doctrine of the Faith, for he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to them in this ſame Epiſtle, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.3. that he fears <hi>leſt as Satan beguiled Eve, ſo their minds ſhould be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt.</hi> 4. And if we could have been aſſured (as we cannot) that the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of truth in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> was a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> this would plead much for the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> rather than of the <hi>Roman,</hi> which agreeth not with it, and ſo would deſtroy <hi>Romiſh Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                     <p>But as this Diſcourſers citations of Scripture Authority are very impertinent, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> I ſhall in brief obſerve, whether the Scripture do not evidently declare it ſelf to be the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> To the which purpoſe, beſides many other places, obſerved in the foregoing part of this anſwer, let theſe be conſidered, S. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>It ſeemed good to me alſo, having had perfect underſtanding of all things from the very firſt, to write unto thee in order, moſt excellent Theophilus, that thou maiſt know the certainty of thoſe things, wherein thou haſt been inſtructed.</hi> Now that is a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> which is the beſt way to aſcertain us of Faith; and from theſe words it is evident, that even in the times of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> the common delivery by word of mouth, which <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus</hi> had heard of, concerning matter of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, was not ſo certain as the Evangelical writing; and therefore this Goſpel was written, that <hi>Theophilus</hi> might know the certainty of thoſe things. S. <hi>John</hi> would not have written his Goſpel to this end, <hi>that we might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> Joh. 20.31. if he did not think this writing ſhould direct and rule our Faith. S. <hi>Paul</hi> would not have told his <hi>Philippians,</hi> Phil. 3.1. <hi>To write the ſame things for you is ſafe,</hi> unleſs notwithſtanding the force of delivery by word of mouth, they ſtood in need of this advantage of the Apoſtles writing for their ſafety and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment; nor yet would this be ſafe for them, unleſs this writing was ſufficient to effect this eſtabliſhment, which could not be, unleſs it was a <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea that the writing of Scripture was the way, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> by which the ſpirit of God intended to preſerve the Doctrine of Faith in after times, when the Apoſtles were deceaſed, S. <hi>Peter</hi> declares, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I will not be negligent to put you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in remembrance of theſe things, though you know them,</hi> v. 15. <hi>I will indeavour that you may be able after my deceaſe, to have theſe things alwaies in remembrance.</hi> And <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> which the Apoſtle uſeth, ſignifies to make a ſhort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal of things, for the help of memory. Now if this was the deſign of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Epiſtle, it will neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:170758:246"/>that the preſerving Chriſtian Doctrine in memory, is beſt ſecured by the Written Word of God, otherwiſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they could not have been able to have theſe things in remembrance. And leſt, if this Apoſtle had ſaid no more of this ſubject, any might have objected, that he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured they might be able to have theſe things in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance by Tradition, he himſelf directly ſhews, that this is the advantage of his writing, and the end of both his Epiſtles, 2 Pet. 3.1. <hi>This ſecond Epiſtle, beloved, I write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, in both which, I ſtir up your pure minds, by way of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi> So that notwithſtanding the force of delivery by word of mouth, he thought writing neceſſary to keep theſe things in their remembrance.

                     <p>This <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> was held under <hi>Pope Martin,</hi>

Again, from <hi>Leo, He who was incarnate for us by his uncreated will, and operation of his Divinity, of his will wrought Miracles, whence he teſtifies, ſaying, As the Father raiſeth the dead, and quickens them, ſo the Son quickneth whom he will: by his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated will and operation, he who is God above nature, as man, willingly underwent hunger, thirſt, reproach, ſorrow and fear, and this again the Evangeliſt teſtifies, ſaying, he went into an houſe, and would have none know, but could not lye hid: and again, They went through</hi> Galilee, <hi>and he would not that any ſhould know; And again, he would go into</hi> Galilee; <hi>alſo they gave him Wine mingled with Gall, and when he had taſted thereof, he would not drink</hi> So S. <hi>Auſtin, Ambroſe, Cyril, &amp;c.</hi> in their teſtimonies read in this Council, to prove the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane will of Chriſt, urge farther, <hi>If it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me; nevertheleſs not as I will, but as thou wilt: My ſoul is ſorrowful to death: Now is my ſoul troubled.</hi> And <hi>Deus-dedit</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> declared in this <hi>Council,</hi> that the teſtimony of <hi>Cyrill</hi> of urging thoſe Texts, <hi>was for the perfect refuting thoſe Hereticks.</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thus gloſſing concerning Chriſts Humane Nature, <hi>If we ſay he was not ſorry, when the Goſpel ſaith, My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful; if we ſay he did not eat, when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſaith he did eat; the worm of rottenneſs creepeth in, and there will be nothing left ſound, then his body was not real, nor his fleſh real; but what ever was written of him, brethren, is accompliſhed, and is true:</hi> So far S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> there cited and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. So that we ſee they grounded all along upon the Scriptures, and the neceſſary conſequence of his having two wills, from his having two Natures. And when in this Council was read the Type of <hi>Paul</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> wherein he prohibited all diſputes, about Chriſt's having or not having two wills, the <hi>Council liked his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:170758:248"/>to have all contention ceaſe; but declared their diſlike of his dealing alike with the truth and the error; yet they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that if he could have, and had ſhewed by the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of Scripture, that both were equally ſubject to reproof or praiſe, his Type had been well.</hi> All this conſidered, there is no more in the words cited by this <hi>Diſcourſer,</hi> to prove they made <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> their Rule, than when the Church of <hi>England</hi> declares her conſent with any <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of others, or any <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Fathers, and ſhall ſay, We agree to all there ſpoken; it could be thence concluded, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> for her <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>

                     <p>THe laſt Council he produceth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is the <hi>ſecond Council of Nice;</hi> whoſe Authority if it was indeed on his ſide, yet would it no way tend to determine this Controverſie; and he cannot but know, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have no great eſteem for that <hi>Council,</hi> having theſe ſeveral things ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to object againſt it. 1. That it was a <hi>Council</hi> above eight hundred years after Chriſt, not only celebrated in that time, when the purity of Primitive Doctrine was much declined; but even the matters therein declared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the worſhip of <hi>Images,</hi> were innovations, and not agreeable to the more ancient Church. 2. That this <hi>Council</hi> cannot in reaſon be pretended, to declare the general <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of the Church Catholick; when it is certain, that immediately before it, a <hi>Council</hi> of 330 Biſhops at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> defined the contrary; and the like was preſently after it done by a <hi>German</hi> Council. 3. They delivered that as the ſenſe of the Church <hi>Catholick,</hi> which was not ſuch, nor will the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church acknowledge it to be ſuch, in Act 5. of that <hi>Council,</hi> when the Book of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> was read, wherein it was aſſerted, That the ſenſe of the <hi>Catholick Church was, that Angels and Souls of men, were not wholly incorporeal, but had Bodies, and therefore were</hi> imitabiles picturâ, as <hi>Binius</hi> hath it, <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentable by Pictures; Tharaſius</hi> and the <hi>Synod</hi> approved of it. Yet here <hi>Carranza</hi> in his Collection of the Councils, adds a Note, that this is not yet determined by the Church; and obſerves, that many of the Fathers aſſerted the <hi>Angels</hi> to be wholly incorporeal, whom the firſt <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> ſeems to follow. <hi>Pamelius</hi> puts it among the <hi>Paradoxes</hi> of
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:170758:249"/>
                        <hi>Tertullian,</hi> (<hi>Parad.</hi> 7.) which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> condemned, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the <hi>Souls</hi> of men to have any <hi>effigies</hi> and <hi>colour:</hi> and both <hi>Pamelius</hi> upon <hi>Tertul.</hi> and <hi>Baron. ad an.</hi> 173. <hi>n.</hi> 31. derive the original of this Opinion from the <hi>Montaniſts.</hi> 4. It is evidenceable by many inſtances, that they ſatisfied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with very weak proof, both from Scriptures, and from the Fathers, as hath been by ſeveral <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>Yet as bad as this <hi>Council</hi> was, which was bad enough; I aſſert, That it was not of this <hi>Diſcourſers</hi> judgment, that <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> is the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> In order to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing of which, I ſhall firſt examine his citations.</p>
                     <p>His firſt citation is out of <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                        <hi>We imbued with the precepts of the Fathers, have ſo confeſſed, and do confeſs.</hi> Which words I ſuppoſe he took out of <hi>Carranza,</hi> where they are curtly delivered: for ſure had he read them, as they are at large in the <hi>Council,</hi> he would never have been ſo miſtaken, as to have applied them to <hi>Oral Tradition.</hi> The words more at large, are thus ſpoken by <hi>Tharaſius, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and approved by the <hi>Synod. Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Primate</hi> of <hi>old Rome, ſeems to me to have written clearly and truly, both to our Emperours, and to us, and hath declared the ancient Tradition of the Church to be right. Wherefore we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſearching by the Scriptures, by inquiring, arguing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating, and alſo being imbued with the precepts of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, have ſo confeſſed, and do confeſs, and will confeſs, and do confirm the force of the Letters read.</hi> So that whatever is here ſpoken concerning a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> muſt be this; that that which upon inquiry may be made appear by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Demonſtrations, to be the Doctrine of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and accords with the ancient Fathers, is delivered to us by the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> And is this the Doctrine deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this <hi>Diſcourſer,</hi> or by <hi>Proteſtants?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet further, theſe words of <hi>Tharaſius,</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> confirming the Letters of <hi>Adrian</hi> then read; we may obſerve how thoſe Letters alſo as they were recorded by that <hi>Council,</hi> agree with the Proteſtant Doctrine. Now <hi>Adrian</hi> in that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:170758:250"/>to <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and <hi>Irene,</hi> which <hi>Tharaſius</hi> refers to, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them to acquieſce in the <hi>Tradition of the Orthodox Faith, in the Church of Bleſſed</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul, <hi>the chief of the Apoſtles, and to imbrace it, as it hath been done by other Emperours, honouring their Vicar with all their heart. For, theſe chief of the Apoſtles, who did begin the Catholick Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Faith, did command their Faith to be preſerved by writing, as by Laws enacted, even to all them who ſhould ſucceed them in their Seats,</hi> and ſo <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> our Church doth keep it. Yea, as to the Queſtion in hand then about Images, <hi>Adrian</hi> there urgeth Arguments from Scripture, with ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as this, <hi>As the holy Scripture hath it, ſo let us have it:</hi> and after his arguments from Scripture adds, <hi>wherefore it is not to be doubted;</hi> and then indeavours to ſhew the conſent of Fathers. Whence it is evident, <hi>Adrian</hi> urged the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors to cloſe with the delivery of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe then that Church did keep to the written Laws of the Apoſtles, and by this means preſerved their Faith: and Scripture he follows, to put things out of doubt; this was then, as appears, the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and if that be it which will pleaſe this Diſcourſer, let him take it, and follow it.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Act.</hi> 3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of this <hi>Council,</hi> this Diſcourſer cites theſe words, <hi>We receive and venerate the Apoſtolical Traditions of the Church.</hi> But is this enough for this Authors purpoſe? 1. Is every thing that is received and venerated, made a <hi>Rule of Faith?</hi> 2. Muſt theſe <hi>Apoſtolical Traditions</hi> needs be <hi>Oral Tradition?</hi> Or did the Apoſtles deliver nothing in Writing? Theſe words are in an Epiſtle of <hi>Theodore</hi> of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> to that <hi>Council,</hi> which was by it approved: but in that Epiſtle, as throughout this <hi>Council</hi> they pretended to the Scriptures and Doctrine of the Fathers, cited from their Writings, to aſcertain them of the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, as to the then diſputed point concerning Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Yea, that we may know what in that Epiſtle was meant by Apoſtolical Tradition, it is more plain in the end of that Epiſtle in theſe words; <hi>Whereas therefore it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:170758:250"/>plain, that the Scripture receiveth them, wherefore it is lawful.</hi> Whence, though this <hi>Council</hi> was erroneous in the deciſion of the Controverſie then in the World, for ought hath been yet produced, it doth not appear to have been in the ſame error with this <hi>Diſcourſer,</hi> concerning the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>

                     <p>His next teſtimony from this Council is, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> where the Council have theſe words; <hi>We walking in the Kings High-way, and inſiſting upon the Doctrine of our holy and Divine Fathers, and obſerving the Tradition of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, in which the holy Spirit dwells, do define.</hi> But what if the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> meant by them, was not <hi>Oral,</hi> but <hi>written?</hi> As for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers teſtimonies its plain, they were not received by <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> but were ſuch as were found in their Writings, and were thence cited both in the Letter of <hi>Adrian</hi> in the ſecond action of that <hi>Council,</hi> and in the teſtimonies produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. As for <hi>Tradition</hi> it is obſervable, that in the definition of this <hi>Council,</hi> in which are the forecited words, they declare, that they receive the Churches <hi>Traditions, whether in Cuſtome or in Writing; but then they declare things ſo received by them to agree to the Goſpel;</hi> and all ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the Church if truly ſuch, will <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive as this <hi>Council.</hi> Theſe things they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, though they did not make them a <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> And that the <hi>Tradition</hi> they relied on as the ground of their Faith, was chiefly the holy Scriptures, may appear proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, becauſe in the beginning of the fourth <hi>Action,</hi> where they produce the grounds of their <hi>Tradition,</hi> they firſt urge ſeveral Scriptures, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. <hi>Numb.</hi> 7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 41. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. and others; and after them the Fathers Writings: but it appears more certainly in the <hi>ſeventh Action,</hi> where is their <hi>Synodical Epiſtle to</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>and</hi> Irene, in which they urge many Scriptures, to prove the truth of what this <hi>Council</hi> defined, and then ſay, <hi>Theſe</hi> (to wit Scriptures) <hi>being ſo confeſſedly, and without all doubt, we believe, theſe things to be acceptable and pleaſing to God.</hi> Whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:170758:251"/>that the Rule by which they did without all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing believe, was the holy Scriptures; and what elſe is a <hi>Rule of Faith?</hi> So that they principally relied on the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and in conſent with them, on the written Doctrine of the ancient Fathers, and the cuſtoms of the Catholick Church. And this is that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will not diſclaim, but allow as a Rule, though they will keep better to it, than this ſeventh General Council (as it is called) did.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> From the <hi>firſt Action</hi> of this Council, he cites theſe words, which were ſpoken by <hi>Baſilius</hi> of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> as part of a recantation of his former opinions, and ſeem to be allowed by that Council: <hi>They who contemn the Writings of the holy Fathers, and the Tradition of the Catholick Church, and bring for their excuſe, and inculcate the words of</hi> Arius, Neſtorius, Eutyches, <hi>and</hi> Dioſcorus; ſaying, <hi>unleſs we were ſufficiently inſtructed out of the Old and New Teſtament, we would follow the Doctrines of the Fathers, and of the ſix ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Synods, and the Traditions of the Catholick Church, let him be accurſed.</hi> And ſo will <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay, They who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the preaching of the holy Fathers, and the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Catholick Church againſt <hi>Arius,</hi> and thoſe other <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> (which <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> did declare it ſelf grounded, and was truly grounded upon Scripture; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing and venting the words of theſe <hi>Hereticks,</hi> which we know were againſt Scripture, though theſe perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Scripture to be on their ſide, which we know is not;) let him be accurſed. Nor from theſe words will it follow, as he would have it, that it was ever the pretence of moſt execrable <hi>Hereticks,</hi> to decline <hi>Tradition,</hi> and pretend ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient light from Scripture; the contrary to this, hath been by me ſhewed, and will be further manifeſted. Theſe words do not ſpeak it the conſtant practice of <hi>Hereticks</hi> to pretend to Scripture; but only ſpeak of ſome certain <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> whoſe time is defined to be betwixt the <hi>ſixth</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth General Councils:</hi> for if they had not lived after the <hi>ſixth Council,</hi> they could not have declared, why they
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:170758:251"/>did not follow the <hi>ſix General Councils;</hi> and if they had not lived before the <hi>ſeventh General Council,</hi> their words could not have been there produced. But ſuch words as theſe of thoſe <hi>Hereticks,</hi> which decline the true <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church founded in Scripture, and ſatisfie themſelves with empty pretences of Scripture, Proteſtants will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn. Yet leſt the gloſs upon theſe words ſhould not ſeem a ſufficient anſwer; without further proof of what is there intimated, I ſhall undertake to evidence, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>ancient Church</hi> againſt thoſe <hi>Hereticks,</hi> was ſuch as was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Scripture, as their <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> and that thoſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> aſſertions were therefore rejected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were contrary to theſe Scriptures: Which I ſhall do in examining what were the grounds of Faith, upon which the Catholick Fathers proceeded, at the time of the <hi>four firſt General Councils;</hi> in which were theſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> condemned, as alſo <hi>Macedonius</hi> in the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Council.</hi>

Wherefore when no Scripture of Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, uſeth theſe words [concerning the Son] that he was of things that were not, and that it was once when he was not, it is no way fit to ſpeak or teach ſuch things.</hi>

                        <hi>We can mention the Biſhops which were by the Apoſtles inſtituted in the Churches, and were their Succeſſors; and if they had known any Myſteries to teach them, who are perfect, they would not have concealed them from them.</hi> Further to manifeſt what was this <hi>Tradition,</hi> he refers to <hi>Clemens</hi> his Epiſtle, ſaying, <hi>from thence they who will, may know the Apoſtolical Tradition of the Church, That there is one God,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <hi>That the Church are the depoſitory of truth, and if any have any diſpute of any queſtion, ought they not to have recourſe to the ancient Churches in which the Apoſtles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, and from them to receive what is certain concerning the preſent queſtion.</hi> And then he adds, which our <hi>Diſcourſer</hi> alſo cites, <hi>p.</hi> 131. <hi>But what if the Apoſtles had not left us the Scriptures, ought we not to follow the order of Tradition, which they delivered to thoſe to whom they committed the Churches? To which Ordination, aſſent many Nations of thoſe Barbarians, who believe in Chriſt, having ſalvation written in their hearts by the Spirit, without Paper and Ink, and diligently keeping the ancient Tradition, believing in one God,</hi> &amp;c. And after ſaith, <hi>They who believe this Faith without letters, are Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as to our ſpeech.</hi> Cap. 5. He ſaith, <hi>Tradition being thus in the Church, let us come to that proof which is from Scripture;</hi> and ſo ſpends ſeveral Chapters in ſhewing the Doctrine of Chriſt and the Apoſtles out of Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>From what hath been obſerved, it is evident, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 1. That the Hereticks <hi>Irenaeus</hi> dealt with, were in ſome thing of the Spirit of this <hi>Diſcourſer,</hi> that is, only for their own <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and would neither be tryed by Scriptures, nor any other <hi>Tradition,</hi> but what was amongſt themſelves: as our <hi>Diſcourſer</hi> will diſown tryal by Scriptures, and by what was delivered in the <hi>Fathers Writings</hi> or <hi>Councils, Cor.</hi> 14.
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:170758:257"/>and from all other Churches but the <hi>Roman Church, Cor.</hi> 13, 17. 2. That the reaſon why he ſo much inſiſted upon <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> was becauſe theſe Hereticks, as they denied Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, ſo they pretended to the beſt <hi>Tradition:</hi> which way of his arguing ſpeaks not <hi>Tradition</hi> the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> but of conſiderable uſe in this caſe; even as if we ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with a Pagan who owns not Chriſtian Revelation, concerning the truth of Chriſtian Religion; the uſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Arguments againſt him, will ſhew that we count them very uſeful in this caſe, but will not conclude that we own reaſon and not revelation, for a <hi>Rule of Faith:</hi> ſo if a Chriſtian ſhall urge the Doctrine of the Old Teſtament, as ſufficient and certain againſt the <hi>Jew,</hi> it would be a vain conſequence to inferr, that he makes this only, and not the New Teſtament-Revelation, the Rule of his Chriſtian Faith. 3. That <hi>Irenaeus</hi> did not think the urging the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church, ſufficient againſt thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, but thought it neceſſary to have recourſe to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Churches Tradition; and this Doctrine of the ancient Church, he evidenceth ſufficiently from the writings, as alſo from the verbal teſtimonies, of them who were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the ancient Church: and Proteſtants are as ready as any to appeal to the ancient Church, and had we ſuch a man as <hi>Polycarp,</hi> who converſed with S. <hi>John,</hi> we would receive his teſtimony as far as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> did. But having only ancient Writings, which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> thought ſufficient, in the caſe of <hi>Tradition,</hi> we readily appeal to them. 4. That when <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaies the Apoſtles <hi>Tradition</hi> is manifeſt in the whole World, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. or <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3. though there be divers tongues in the World, yet the vertue of <hi>Tradition</hi> is one and the ſame. That is the Church in the whole World believes and delivers the ſame Faith: He ſpeaks this againſt thoſe Hereticks, about thoſe great Articles of Faith. That <hi>there is one God,</hi> and <hi>one Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. as himſelf expreſſeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. and <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. for even in the time of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> there was not in all the World an agreement in all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; ſince <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> did not
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:170758:258"/>agree in this, whether it was Lawful to Excommunicate the <hi>Aſian Churches</hi> for their different obſervation of <hi>Eaſter, Euſ. Hiſt. Eccl. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 6. Now is this any conſequence, That Doctrine which teacheth <hi>one God,</hi> &amp;c. againſt thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, was generally continued in the Church till <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time; which was not two hundred years after Chriſt; therefore all Doctrine muſt certainly be preſerved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corruption in the Churches Delivery above ſixteen hundred Years after Chriſt? though we certainly know that beſides Proteſtants, other Churches do not now deliver the ſame things. 5. When he ſaid, <hi>Ought we not to have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed</hi> Tradition, <hi>if the Apoſtles had not left us the Scriptures?</hi> He ſaith not, <hi>we ought to do ſo now they have left them;</hi> but rather in theſe words intimates the contrary.</p>
                     <p>But now more directly to ſee his opinion of the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi>

If we cannot find the ſolution of all things in Scripture, we muſt believe God in theſe things, knowing that the Scriptures are perfect, being ſpoken by the word of God, and his Spirit.</hi> Lib. 4. c. 66. <hi>Read more diligently the Goſpel, which is given us by the Apoſtles, and read more diligently the Prophets, and you ſhall find every action, and every Doctrine, and every paſſion of our Lord, ſet forth in them</hi> Lib. 3. c. 11. <hi>The Goſpel is the pillar and firmament of the Church, and the Spirit of life: wherefore it is conſequent,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:170758:258"/>that it hath four pillars—he hath given us a fourfold Goſpel, which is contained in one Spirit.</hi> If then according to <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> men may believe by the Scripture, and that is the pillar and foundation of Faith, and they that ſeek, may find all Doctrine in it, which is there clear and manifeſt, is not this enough to ſhew, he makes it a <hi>Rule of Faith?</hi> If not, we have obſerved him calling it by the name of a Rule alſo, and declaring, that none but the Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did then receive the Faith in an unwritten way.</p>

The firſt place he cites, but names not the Book, is, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cont. Marc. l.</hi> 5. where <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s deſign is, to declare the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Tradition</hi> in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, to be preferred before what <hi>Marcion</hi> tenders, as his emending the Goſpel, and ſo confirms the Proteſtant Doctrine. For having obſerved that <hi>Marcion</hi> rejects the other <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and corrupteth <hi>Luke,</hi> He ſaith in the end of the fourth <hi>ch. From the times of</hi> Tiberius, <hi>to</hi> Antonine, <hi>we meet with</hi> Marcion, <hi>as the firſt and only emender of the Goſpel.</hi> And he obſerves his emending confirms ours, whilſt he emends that which he found firſt, (then follow the words cited by this Authour) In ſhort, <hi>If it be manifeſt, that is the more true, which was the former; and that was the former which is from the beginning; that from the beginning which is from the Apoſtles: in like manner that will manifeſtly appear to be delivered from the Apoſtles, which is accounted Sacred in the Churches of the Apoſtles.</hi> In which words, <hi>Tertullian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to eſtabliſh the Scripture-writings againſt the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical corruption. Whence it follows, <hi>Let us ſee what Milk the</hi> Corinthians <hi>drew from</hi> Paul; <hi>to what Rule the</hi> Galatians <hi>were corrected; What the</hi> Philippians, Theſſalonians <hi>and</hi> Epheſians, <hi>read,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſends to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which may be read.</p>

He ſheweth, <hi>the Apoſtles never delivered any ſuch thing as this, but fully aſſerted one and the ſame God. Nor was there ever any queſtion about this in their daies: for as there were queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about things offered to Idols, about Marriage and Divorce,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:170758:262"/>about veiling Women, and the hope of the Reſurrection,</hi> (in which he plainly refers to the Apoſtles writings): ſo he ſaith, if <hi>there had been any Queſtion about this matter, it would have been found as a moſt principal thing in the Apoſtle</hi> (that is the Apoſtles writings) and then adds the words ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this <hi>Diſcourſer:</hi> And <hi>no other is to be acknowledged the Tradition of the Apoſtles, than that which is this day publiſhed in their Churches.</hi> In which words, as <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> elſewhere did againſt Heretical inventions in general, ſo he here eſtabliſheth the Churches <hi>Tradition</hi> againſt <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions</hi> innovation: or he eſtabliſheth the Doctrine of Chriſt, as his Church received it, which principally included the Scriptures. And that <hi>Tertullian,</hi> chiefly deſigned againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> to eſtabliſh the <hi>Scriptural Tradition,</hi> may appear ſufficiently from what hath been above obſerved.</p>
                     <p>To ſee yet more of <hi>Tertullians</hi> mind in this caſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> obſerve that known place againſt <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> who aſſerted matter co-eternal with God. <hi>Adverſ.

But whether all things be made out of a ſubject matter I never yet read; Let</hi> Hermogenes <hi>his ſhop ſhew it written: If it be not written, let him fear that woe, that is denounced againſt them who add or take away.</hi> What can be more full to ſhew the Scripture to be a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> than to declare that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may ſafely be received but from it, and that it is full and compleat?</p>

This, we aſſure him, we will do; and likewiſe highly honor that <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> which <hi>Athanaſius</hi> made uſe of; which we know was not <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> but Scripture. The firſt teſtimony he produceth from <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> is in his Epiſtle <hi>de Synodis Arim. &amp; Seleuc.</hi> where ſpeaking of the <hi>Arians</hi> who were not ſatisfied in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> but ſought after ſome other Synodical determination, where they might have the Faith; and therefore procured another <hi>Council</hi> to be called; he ſaith, <hi>Now they have declared themſelves to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, in ſeeking that which they have not:</hi> (which are part of the words cited by this <hi>Diſcourſer:</hi> his following words, I think, cannot be found either in that Book, or elſewhere in <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> which are) <hi>All therefore that are ſeekers of Faith
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:170758:264"/>are unbelievers.

And if for this there ſhould be need of a Synod, there are the Acts of the Holy Fathers, they who came together in</hi> Nice, <hi>wrote ſo well, that whoever faithfully read their Writings, may by them be remembred of that Religion towards Chriſt, which is declared in the holy Scriptures.</hi> So that theſe words of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> as they deſign not the promoting <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> ſo they do advance Scripture.</p>
                     <p>The next teſtimony cited, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and vainly flouriſhed over, is from <hi>Athan. de Incarn.</hi> againſt <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> where he concerning this Subject of the Incarnation of the Word, ſhews, That <hi>ſuch great things, and difficult to be apprehended, cannot be attained to, but by Faith.

Wherefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>bleſſed</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, Great is the myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. A little after he ſaith, <hi>To make an exact ſearch, is that few can do, but to hold faſt the Faith belongs to all who
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:170758:264"/>are perſwaded by God.</hi> Then follow the words cited: <hi>He that ſearcheth after that which is above his reach, is in danger, but he who abides in the things delivered, is out of danger. Wherefore we perſwade you, as alſo we perſwade our ſelves, to keep the Faith delivered, and avoid prophane words of novelty,</hi> (thus far this <hi>Diſcourſer</hi> cites, but then follows) <hi>and to fear an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive ſearch into ſo great Myſteries, but to confeſs, that God was manifeſt in the fleſh, according to the Apoſtles Tradition.</hi> By this view of the whole ſenſe of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> it is evident, he deſigns to put them off from curious queſtions, about theſe high Myſteries, to relie on the written Scripture-<hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> which in theſe words he refers to.

Manich. quam vocant Fundamenti,</hi> in which he brings in the <hi>Manichee,</hi> c. 14. ſaying, <hi>That he doth not promiſe any perfect Science; but ſuch things are ſhewed to him, and that they to whom they are told, ought to believe him in thoſe things which they know not.</hi> To which he anſwers, <hi>If I muſt believe things unknown,</hi> (then follow the words this Authour refers to) <hi>Why ſhould I not rather believe thoſe things that are now celebrated by the conſent of learned and unlearned, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed amongſt all people, by moſt grave Authority?</hi> Here he prefers the conſent and fame of the Church, before that of
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:170758:266"/>the <hi>Manichee:</hi> but this is far from making it a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> but only maketh it the more conſiderable motive: and yet in thoſe things wherein learned and unlearned conſent; Scripture may be their Rule to believe them. And S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> declares, <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. that there are obvious things in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which it ſpeaks to the heart both of the learned and unlearned.</p>
                     <p>What he next adds as ſpoken in the ſame Book by S <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi>

                        <hi>The Authority of the Catholick Church, is of force to cauſe Faith and aſſurance; which</hi> (Authority) <hi>from the beſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed ſeats of the Apoſtles, even to this very day is ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſeries of Biſhops ſucceeding them, and by the aſſertion of ſo many Nations.</hi> Theſe words I find not in that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. He indeed there ſaith, <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>That he had not believed the Goſpel, if the Authority of the Catholick Church had not moved him:</hi> whence it may be inferred, that he makes the Authority of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> ſufficient to cauſe Faith as a Motive to it: and indeed, this is all can be inferred from theſe words here cited. And yet it is obſervable, that the Authority of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which was ſo great a Motive to S. <hi>Austin,</hi> did not confine it ſelf to the preſent Church, but included the Primitive Church, whence, <hi>c.</hi> 3. he calls <hi>it an Authority begun by Miracles, nouriſhed by hope, increaſed by Charity, and confirmed by Antiquity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His laſt teſtimony from S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is, I think, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> miſ-cited as to the place, but the words are (but not in <hi>Ep.</hi> 58. which is not S. <hi>Auſtins</hi>) <hi>The faithful do poſſeſs perſeveringly a</hi> Rule of Faith, <hi>common to little and great in the Church.</hi> But why may not this be the Scripture? can it not be common to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and great, according to S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s language? Who tells us <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. <hi>By the Scriptures bad underſtandings are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, little ones are nouriſhed, and great ones are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> makes the Scripture a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> I might very largely ſhew, though I ſuppoſe a few expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may ſuffice; <hi>Ep.</hi> 157. <hi>Where the thing by nature obſcure is above our capacity, and the Divine Scriptures doth not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:170758:267"/>afford its aſſiſtance, here humane conjecture raſhly preſumes to determine any thing.</hi> And if we would have the word <hi>[Rule]</hi> he ſaith, <hi>De bono Viduitatis: Wherefore ſhould I teach thee any thing more than what we read in the Apoſtle; for the holy Scripture fixeth the Rule of our Doctrine, leſt we ſhould attempt to know more than we ought to know.</hi> De Civ. Dei, lib. 13. c. 18. <hi>The City of God believeth the holy Scriptures both Old and New, which we call Canonical, from thence Faith it ſelf is conceived, out of which the juſt man liveth.</hi> I will yet add only one teſtimony more, <hi>De literis Petiliani, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>If any one, I will not ſay, if we, no way to be compared to him,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Though we;</hi> but as in the following words he added, <hi>If an Angel from Heaven ſhould preach unto you, either concerning Chriſt, or his Church, or any other thing which belongs to our Faith or Life; beſides what you have received in the Legal and Evangelical Scriptures, let him be accurſed.</hi> But enough now of this famous Father.</p>

                     <p>BUT becauſe §. 15. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> he ſuppoſeth he hath there given a few notes, which will make all teſtimonies of <hi>Fathers,</hi> for <hi>Scripture</hi> againſt <hi>Tradition,</hi> loſe their edge: I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them.</p>
                     <p>His firſt Note is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                        <hi>That in almoſt all his citations of Councils,</hi> and <hi>Fathers, they ſpeak directly againſt Hereticks;</hi> which <hi>puts them to declare what fixed them Catholicks.</hi> Now from this firſt Note, ſince I have ſhewed, that in all ſuch places they own Scripture for the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> the citations to that purpoſe, are the more firm for Scripture.</p>
                     <p>His ſecond Note is to conſider, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                        <hi>Whether when Fathers ſpeak highly of Scripture, as that it contains all Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whether they ſpeak of Scripture ſenſed, or as yet to be ſenſed?</hi> Truly if he be a man of reaſon, he will eaſily ſee that, when the <hi>Fathers</hi> urge Scriptures as manifeſtly declaring the truth, againſt their oppoſers, who as yet diſown the ſenſe, or to Doubters who do not yet own it fully; they muſt needs mean the Scriptures, without any ſenſe impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:170758:268"/>them otherwiſe, than as the words will of themſelves diſcover the ſenſe of him who wrote them. For this would be a weak way to diſpute from Scriptures, (as the Fathers generally did with them who owned them) if they ſhould ſay, we will evidence it from Scriptures, but you muſt then firſt ſuppoſe them to mean as we mean. By this means the Scripture can give no evidence or light to any truth in queſtion, which is contrary to the whole current of our citations, from the <hi>Fathers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third Note is, <hi>That it is frequent with the Fathers,</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                        <hi>to force Hereticks to accept the ſenſe of Scripture, from thoſe who gave them the Letter of Scripture, and frequent to ſenſe the Letter (even when dark) by Tradition, but never to bend Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the outward ſhew of the Letter.</hi> As to the firſt clauſe of urging upon Hereticks, the ſenſe which they own from whom they received the Letter: The Fathers never ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this but in ſome ſpecial caſe: when <hi>Hereticks,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and ſome others, who could ſcarce be called receivers of the Scripture-Letter, diſowned the known and common ſignifications of words in Scriptures, and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced wonderful ſtrange ones. Here to preſerve the Faithful, confirm the Doubtful, and reduce the wandring, they urged the Churches Authority, or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Tradition</hi> of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and common delivery of ſignifications of words, as more conſiderable than ſuch ſenſibly monſtrous innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: yet this was in things where, to men unprejudiced, and willing to receive truth, they would appear plainly from the very words of Scripture. And this is conſiſtent (if there were the like cauſe) with the Principles of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> as with any others. In other caſes the <hi>Fathers</hi> ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt the <hi>Hereticks</hi> evident arguments from the light of Scripture-Letter. Nor did they ſenſe Scripture by <hi>Tradition</hi> in hard Texts of Scripture, otherwiſe than <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> will do; that is where any aſſertion is known to be a point of Faith, and ſurely grounded upon Scripture, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they nor we will ſo interpret any dark Scripture, as to oppoſe ſuch a point of Faith: and in many other things
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:170758:269"/>will allow <hi>Tradition</hi> its degree of authority. But that they never bent <hi>Tradition</hi> to Scriptures <hi>Letter,</hi> is very untrue. When any truly Catholick Doctrine held by the Church, was queſtioned or impugned, was not <hi>Tradition</hi> bent to Scriptures <hi>Letter,</hi> when they applyed themſelves to it, to declare and manifeſt ſuch Doctrine? Which was the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral practice of the Ancients, as hath been ſhewed. But would they ever ſo bend <hi>Tradition</hi> to <hi>Scripture,</hi> as to cloſe with Scripture in rejecting <hi>Tradition?</hi> If that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by <hi>Catholick Biſhops</hi> be a <hi>Tradition,</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Eccleſ.</hi> c. 10. ſayes, <hi>We muſt not conſent with Catholick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, if they think any thing againſt the Scriptures of God.</hi> But did ever any of the Ancient Fathers ſay, that we muſt not agree with Scripture, if it ſpeaks againſt what the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who are called <hi>Catholick,</hi> do deliver?</p>
                     <p>His laſt Note is a very vain and empty one: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                        <hi>That they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold Scripture thus interpretable, the</hi> Rule of Faith; <hi>becauſe moſt Hereticks againſt whom they wrote, held it theirs, and therefore could not be Hereticks, ſince they held the Rule.</hi> But <hi>firſt,</hi> thoſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> who pretended to own Scripture (who were not the moſt) did not perfectly hold the ſame Rule, with Catholicks who held to Scripture as their Rule. The Catholicks Rule is Scripture, as the words will naturally hold forth the true and genuine ſenſe: but the Rule of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks who pretended to Scripture, is Scripture, as the words are wilfully perverted, contrary to their natural and plain ſenſe and meaning. But again, why may not they be Hereticks, who profeſs to hold the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> if they take no heed to be guided by that Rule, and reject Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines declared by it? cannot reaſon be a Rule in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, becauſe two parties both pretend to reaſon?</p>
                     <p>I have now diſmiſſed his teſtimonies. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> In the laſt place, he undertakes to ſhew, <hi>That the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>and the preſent Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>own this way of Oral and Practical Tradition.</hi> Now though I could ſhew that in the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where this Author pretends ſo great a
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:170758:269"/>clearneſs of Tradition, they are not yet agreed upon the firſt principle of Traditionary Doctrine. Yet ſince I have enough ſhewed the diſſent of this his opinion from the truth, and the Ancient Church; and therefore if they all were of this Authors opinion, it will neither make any thing for their own Doctrine, nor againſt the Proteſtants: I will for my part let him injoy the fruit of his labours in this particular, fearing moſt that Papiſts will indeavour in this point to deal with Proteſtants, as we above obſerved, that the <hi>Arians</hi> did with the ancient Catholicks; that is, like <hi>Chamaelions,</hi> change their ſhape, and when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed in one way, they oppoſed the truth in another.</p>

                     <p>And ſince Chriſtians being eſtabliſhed in the Truth, is of great uſe both to their own and the Churches Peace; in order hereunto the Paſtors of the Church in Councils have power to abandon Heretical and dangerous Doctrines, and to require ſubmiſſion to the Truth they declare. This was done in the Synod of the Apoſtles, againſt the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Circumciſion; and in the four firſt general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, concerning the Doctrine of the Trinity, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Mediator. And ſuch Deciſions concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Doctrine, when managed aright, have been deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reverenced in the Church; ſince one end of God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing theſe Officers is, that we ſhould <hi>be no more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, toſſed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4.14.</note> And upon this account a particular Honour is due to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Doctrine of our Church, which hath a high agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Rule of Scripture, and the Catholick and Primitive Church.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe things, all particular Officers of the Church in their charge, are to watch over thoſe committed to them, as much as in them lies, with ſpecial regard to the Sick, and to thoſe alſo who need to be Catechiſed in the Principles of Religion,<note place="margin">John 21.15.</note> (it being our Saviour's firſt charge to S. <hi>Peter</hi> to feed his Lambs,) with earneſt Prayer for the Grace and Bleſſing of God upon them all.</p>

The Miniſtry of Reconciliation includeth an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of rebuking and admoniſhng Offenders, of caſting them out of the Church, and of reſtoring them again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Repentance. This hath been the ordinarily received ſenſe of thoſe great words of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.18.</note> 
                        <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven; and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi> There is indeed a late Objection made, that theſe words ſpeak not of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:170758:275"/>and looſing Perſons, but Things; and that it is uſual with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers to expreſs the binding and looſing of Things, not of Perſons; meaning thereby the declaring or judging ſuch things prohibited or allow'd. But beſides what may be otherwiſe ſaid, I think it ſufficient at preſent to obſerve, that the admitting this notion may well enough conſiſt with the true ſenſe of theſe words; which if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by it, will import: 1. That the power of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and looſing hath a conſiderable reſpect to ſuch things, as the Caſes, Offences, and Penitent Performances of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and ſutably our Saviour after his Reſurrection gave his Apoſtles the authority of remitting and retaining Sins, which phraſe alſo immediately reſpecteth not Perſons but Things; but yet binding in this ſenſe muſt include an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative declaring the Practices of Men to be ſo far Evil, as to deprive the offending Perſons of their Chriſtian Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. 2. Theſe words will alſo imply that the Officers of the Church are intruſted to bind and continue, or to looſe and diſcharge the obſervation of Penitential Rules; and accordingly the Apoſtle ſaith, to whom you forgive <hi>any thing,</hi> I forgive it alſo in the Perſon of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10.</p>
                     <p>And even this ſevere part of Eccleſiaſtical Power, is for Edification, not Deſtruction, both to the whole Church, and to the Offender, that through Repentance his Spirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord; and ſo is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly included under the Miniſtry of Reconciliation. The general reſult of all I have ſaid, is, That the Office of the Miniſtry is of very high and great importance; and ſuch perſons who have a low eſteem thereof, if they have any reverence for their Saviour, let them ſeriouſly conſider, whether he who is Truth and Goodneſs, can be thought to uſe ſuch high expreſſions in this caſe, as to declare his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; and that what they bind on Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven, and ſuch like; to impoſe upon the World which he came, to guide and ſave, and upon his Church which he ſo dearly
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:170758:276"/>loves, with empty ſounds of great things, which ſignify little or nothing.</p>
                     <p>What a mighty ſenſe had the Primitive Chriſtians of this power of the Keys, when the Penitent Offenders un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cenſure undertook, according to ſome Canons, the ſtrict obſervation of Penance,<note place="margin">Conc. Ancyr. c. 16. Elib. c. 2, 7, 47, 63. Valent. cap. 3.</note> ſometimes for 20 or 30 years, and even to the end of their Life, that they might obtain Abſolution, and the Peace of the Church, and its Communion: And under this ſevere Diſcipline, as <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> deſcribes it by the name of their <hi>Exomologeſis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">de Poenit. c. 9.</note> they did ly in Sackcloth and Aſhes; they never uſed ſuch Cloaths or Diet as might appear pleaſant; they frequently exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed themſelves in Faſting, Prayers and Tears, crying to God day and night; and among other things, they made humble Supplication, even upon their Knees, unto the Members of the Church, and fell down proſtrate before its Officers; it being their cuſtom, <hi>Presbyteris advolvi, &amp; charis Dei adgeniculari.</hi> And all this was done in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, while the Church was under perſecution from the Civil Power.</p>
                     <p>But that which they apprehended, and which I doubt not to be true,<note place="margin">Exam. Conc. Trid. de Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</note> is, that, as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Chriſtus eſt qui per ministerium abſolvit, &amp; peccata remittit;</hi> it is Chriſt who gives Abſolution by his Miniſtry, <hi>viz.</hi> where they proceed according to his Will. And, as under the Law, he who treſpaſſed, beſide the amendment of his fault, and reſtitution, either in things Sacred or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, was to have recourſe to the Treſpaſs-Offering, for obtaining the Mercy of God; even ſo under the Goſpel, he who performs the other conditions of Chriſtianity, ought, where it may be had, to apply himſelf alſo to the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial power of remitting Sin; and the receiving this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, together with that of a good Conſcience, upon a Chriſtian Penitent Deportment, is, next to the great Abſolution by Chriſt, the greateſt encouragement for Peace and Comfort.</p>
                     <pb n="533" facs="tcp:170758:276"/>
                     <p>Only I muſt here add, which I deſire may be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved, that the principal way of miniſterial diſpenſing Remiſſion of Sins, and other Bleſſings of the Goſpel, to them who fall not under groſs enormities, and the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church (though performed alſo in its degree in Doctrine, and other Benedictions and Abſolutions) is chiefly done by Adminiſtring the Holy Sacraments of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Lord's Supper to perſons duly qualified. And it is one of the miſcarriages of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that they take too little notice of this advantage in receiving the Holy <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and do inordinately advance their Sacrament of Penance ſo far into its place, as to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the only Sacrament after Baptiſm, wherein may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained remiſſion of Sins.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I conceive, that as that Man who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Chriſtianity, doth profeſs the Doctrine, and embrace the practice thereof in other things, but wholly omitteth Chriſtian Baptiſm, doth thereby deprive himſelf of the ordinary viſible Teſtimony of God's favour, and runs himſelf upon the needleſs hazard, of hoping to find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by extraordinary Grace, in the neglect of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means thereof: even ſo is it with thoſe adult perſons, who being otherwiſe piouſly diſpoſed, do ordinarily neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the attendance upon the Lord's Supper, which is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly appointed of God, to be a means of conveying and applying the benefits of Chriſt's Holy Sacrifice, for remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins, and other bleſſings of the Covenant, to them who are worthy and meet to receive the ſame. And if this, which to me ſeemeth a great Truth, was duly heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the frequent attendance upon the Holy Communion, and other Services of God, would be, as it was in the Primitive Times, generally looked on as a Duty of very great importance, in Perſons adult, and reſolving upon a true Chriſtian courſe of life.</p>
                     <p>Having aſſerted the nature and excellency of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Power; it will be neceſſary alſo to diſclaim and reject from it theſe two things.</p>

Indeed here it muſt be granted and aſſerted, that the Elements for the Communion were uſually offered to God to be ſet apart for a ſacred Uſe; and that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Worſhip being in a large ſence the offering ſpiritual Sacrifices to God, ſo is eſpecially the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, becauſe therein is eminently a Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the only Sacrifice of Chriſt, with a peculiar Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs unto God thereby, and it, and the Benefits thereof, are myſtically repreſented and exhibited therein. And in this ſence it is ordinarily called a Sacrifice, and a commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sacrifice, in ancient Writers and Liturgies.</p>
                     <p>But the Romiſh Church not ſatisfied herewith, in the <hi>Trent</hi>-Aſſembly thundreth an Anathema againſt them who deny their Maſs to be <hi>verum &amp; proprium Sacrificium,</hi>

                     <p>But this their Sacrifice is contrary to the Doctrine of the Scripture, and derogatory to the Honour of Chriſt's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in that it was the Excellency of his Sacrifice, above the Aaronical Ones, that there is no place for the daily Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and Repetition thereof,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.27. Chap. 10.10, 11, 12, 14.18. Chap. 9.25, 26, 28.</note> ſince by one Offering once made, he hath perfectly accompliſhed the End of Sacrificing, as the Apoſtle largely aſſerteth, nor can he die any more.</p>
                     <p>And their Tranſubſtantiation, on which this is founded, carrieth ſo plain Contradictions to the Evidence of Senſe, the Principles of Reaſon, and the plain Aſſertions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and is attended with ſuch numerous and palpable Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, that the general Belief of ſuch a thing by thoſe of the Romiſh Communion, may be placed among the chief Miracles really wrought in that Church.</p>
                     <p>And the Sacrifice of Chriſt was on this account expiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in that by the Satisfaction he made to his Father, he ſo far appeaſed his Wrath, and procured his Favour towards Man, as to obtain the Terms, Grace, and Bleſſings of the New Covenant. Wherefore if the very ſame Sacrifice be really offered in every Maſs, it muſt be to the ſame end, and then not only the Redemption of Man muſt be there made, but the original Sanction of the Goſpel-Covenant muſt be then, and not before eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this, as the High-Prieſt, who offered the Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifice under the Law, muſt enter with the Blood thereof into the Holy of Holies: So the Apoſtle acquaints us, that Chriſt, who is an High-Prieſt, and an High-Prieſt after the Order of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> offering himſelf as an Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for Sin, muſt by his Blood-enter into the holy Place
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:170758:278"/>not made with hands, even into Heaven it ſelf. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Man can undertake properly to offer this Sacrifice, but ſuch an High-Prieſt, who with the Blood thereof doth enter into Heaven it ſelf,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.11, 12, 23, 24</note> and not ſtill abide upon Earth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We muſt reject all Power of reconciling any adult Perſons unto God, who do not perform the other Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Goſpel-Covenant. If <hi>Simon Magus</hi> receive Baptiſm in Hypocriſy, he doth not receive Remiſſion of Sins, but is in the Bond of Iniquity; and the Devil may enter into him who taketh the holy Communion unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he entred into <hi>Judas.</hi> He that comes to receive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation without pious care of ſerious Repentance, is as the Man under the Law, who came to be purified, but brings an unclean thing with him before the Lord, which is a kind of bidding Defiance to the Holineſs of God, and the Purity of his Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Now the Church of <hi>England</hi> declares in her Liturgy, that Chriſt hath left a Power to his Church to abſolve all Sinners who truly repent, and believe in him: And that he is the merciful Receiver of all true penitent Sinners, and moſt willing to pardon us, if we come unto him with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Repentance, if we will ſubmit our ſelves to him, and from henceforth walk in his Ways; with much more to that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>But in the Romiſh Church, where they make ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between Contrition and Attrition, as that the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is an imperfect Grief, which doth not include the Love of God above all, nor doth always take in with it a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of Sin, as the former doth; their Doctors, out of a ſtrange Looſeneſs of Principles, aſſert, the Duty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition very rarely to oblige any Man. And even the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> favoureth that Poſition,<note place="margin">Seſſ. 14. cap. 4.</note> That Attrition, with the Sacrament of Penance and Abſolution, is ſufficient to pleaſe God; concerning which the Generality of their Authors ſpeak much more plain, and many of them urge the Authority of this Council.</p>
                     <pb n="537" facs="tcp:170758:278"/>
                     <p>This is called by <hi>Valentia, receptiſſimum Axioma,</hi> a moſt received Maxim; and tho there are ſome Doctors,<note place="margin">Greg. de Val. Tom. 4. Diſp. 7. Qu. 8.

And <hi>Canus</hi> aſſerteth, <hi>Deus nihil amplius exigit:</hi> God requires no more, than either Contrition without the Sacrament, or Attrition with the Sacrament.

                     <p>But is this a Doctrine ſuitable to the Purity of God, and the holy Jeſus, that Men may all their Life-time be ſo like to Devils, as not to have any ſingle Act of Hatred againſt Sin, or of Love of God above all things, and yet by a few Words of the Prieſt, as ſtrange a thing as the Power of Tranſubſtantiating, be transformed into Saints, but without any real Holineſs at all? Is this a Repreſentation of Religion like that made in the Scripture, <hi>The Doctrine according to Godlineſs,</hi> which requires <hi>the doing the Will of our Father which is in Heaven,</hi> and declares, <hi>that without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee God?</hi> Or is this like the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Spirit of Chriſtianity, where ſerious diligence in the Exerciſes of Contrition and Piety, was thought requiſite for receiving Abſolution?</p>
                     <pb n="538" facs="tcp:170758:279"/>
                     <p>Shall theſe Men be accounted the Patrons of Good Works, who againſt the Doctrine of St. <hi>James</hi> aſſert, that Men may be ſaved without Works, or any holy Action? and who run up to the higheſt and moſt abſurd Poſitions of Solifidianiſm, even the Belief of the Non-neceſſity of holy Actions and Diſpoſitions? They have found a way, if it be a ſafe one, how Works of Iniquity, tho they ſtand condemned by our Saviour, may have an entrance into Heaven without true Converſion.

                     </p>
                     <p>I now come to diſcourſe of the Perſons to whom this Miniſtration is committed, which I ſhall ſpeak to in a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Conſideration.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To us, the Officers of the Goſpel-Diſpenſation, not to the falſe Apoſtles, nor yet to the Jewiſh Prieſthood. The Miniſtry of the New Teſtament excelleth that of the Old, even as the New Covenant, and the Grace of the Goſpel goeth beyond the Law, as the Apoſtle diſcourſeth largely, in the third Chapter of this ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> The Legal Diſpenſation in general was a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Condemnation, which pronounced a Curſe upon Offenders, but gave not Power and Grace to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Obedience; and the external Obſervations therein enjoined were a heavy Yoke: And that Acceptance which holy Men had with God under the Law, was not from the particular Jewiſh Covenant, as ſuch, but chiefly from the Terms of Grace declared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is called the Father of the Circumciſion, to them who are
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:170758:279"/>not of the Circumciſion only, but who walk in the Steps of the Faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed they had then Sacrifices for Sin, and a Way of Atonement; but theſe things, as they were ſtrictly legal, did only tend to obtain the Favour of God, that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders ſhould not be cut off, or be expoſed to Temporal Judgments: But <hi>it was not poſſible that the Blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould purge away Sins,</hi> the Guilt of which their repeated Oblations did declare to continue. And the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to God, and Obedience, was in theſe Obſervations chiefly valuable.</p>
                     <p>But theſe Sacrifices, as they fell under a more large Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, were alſo Evidences of the Mercy of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Sinners, and were Teſtimonies of God's particular Favour, in being willing to bleſs that People, if they would hear his Voice, and obey him; and did alſo adum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Grace of the New Teſtament,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.21.</note> which the Apoſtle tells us was witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets.</p>
                     <p>But the Goſpel-Miniſtration declareth Chriſt by his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation to have actually obtained and effected a compleat Way of Reconciliation, and confirmed that Covenant which is eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes, and is properly and eminently the Miniſtration of Righteouſneſs, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing moſt excellent Bleſſings, with a ſure and plain way to obtain them, and affording ſuch Aſſiſtances as are needful. And this Goſpel-Reconciliation is ſo committed to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, that they miniſterially diſpenſe the Bleſſings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by declaring its Doctrine, by Benedictions and Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and by diſpenſing the Sacramental Symbols of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To us, with primary reſpect to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who wrote this Epiſtle, and the other Apoſtles. They were in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner intruſted with the Miniſtry of Reconciliation, for they were the chief Witneſſes of Chriſt's Reſurrection, and the principal Teſtifiers of the Chriſtian Faith, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Doctrine and Office immediatly from Chriſt. They were the Foundations, next to Chriſt himſelf, of the
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:170758:280"/>
                        <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> and the infallible Guides thereof, and were furniſhed with ſingular Aſſiſtances, and the Power of the Holy-Ghoſt. And the Extent of their Authority was in ſome parts thereof unconfined and unlimited; even St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he received Grace and Apoſtleſhip for Obedience to the Faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.5.</note> among all Nations, including <hi>Rome</hi> alſo, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Years after St. <hi>Peter</hi> was ſaid to be Biſhop there.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtles were the higheſt Officers of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.28. Eph. 4.11.</note> under Chriſt himſelf; and the Scriptures tell us, God ſet therein firſt Apoſtles, and therefore none above them. Indeed St. <hi>Peter,</hi> whom we highly honour as an eminent Apoſtle, had a kind of Primacy of Order yielded to him, but with no deſign to depreſs the other Apoſtles, above whom he had no diſtinction of Office. The Power of binding and looſing promiſed to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 16.19. was on like manner given to them all, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18. And that ample Commiſſion, <hi>John</hi> 20.21, 23. <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you: Whoſe ſoever Sins ye remit,</hi> &amp;c. doth give them all an equal Authority. And tho St. <hi>Paul</hi> was laſt called, we read that St. <hi>Peter</hi> gave to him the right-hand of Fellowſhip;<note place="margin">Gal. 2.9. 2. Cor. 11.5. Chap. 12.11.</note> and in two ſeveral places of this ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the Holy-Ghoſt tells us he was in nothing behind the very chiefeſt Apoſtles. And tho there are many Privileges and Prerogatives reckoned up to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in which Subject many Romiſh Writers are very diligent; the Prerogatives of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> upon due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, will either equal them, or not be much inferior to them. It was <hi>St. Paul,</hi> not <hi>St. Peter,</hi> who was taken up into the third Heaven, who ſaw our Saviour after his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion into Glory, who laboured more abundantly than they all, who was miraculouſly called, and was in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner <hi>the Apoſtle of the Gentiles,</hi> and who wrote a much greater part of the New Teſtament than any other of the Apoſtles did.</p>
                     <p>And for that late Notion, That the Power of the Keys was given only to <hi>St. Peter,</hi> in that he was appointed by Chriſt, ſingly to declare the Goſpel firſt to the Gentiles:
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:170758:280"/>both this confined ſenſe of the Power of the Keys, and of its being peculiar to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> is againſt the ſenſe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; and alſo that which is particularly inſiſted on is a miſtake. For though God by a Viſion directed St. <hi>Peter</hi> to open the Door to the Gentiles; yet all the Apoſtles had before that time the Commiſſion which he firſt made uſe of, to go and teach all Nations,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19. Mar. 16.16.</note> and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature: So that this was not a ſingular Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity committed to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> but he was firſt made choice of to have a right underſtanding of the extent of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. And it is not to be doubted, but that Authority which did belong to all the Apoſtles, of leading Men to the Church, receiving them into it, governing them in it, and excluding them from it, doth contain the chief part of the power of the Keys.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To us, not only to the Apoſtles, but even to other Officers of the Church, as Biſhops and Prieſts or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is given this Miniſtry of Reconciliation: for if we conſider the nature of this Office, the Miniſtry of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, or which is all one, the Miniſtry of the Goſpel muſt not ceaſe, till the end of it in the Salvation of Men be accompliſhed. And our Saviour both promiſeth his Preſence and Authority to be with his Miniſtry unto the end of the World; and eſtabliſheth them in his Church till we all come in the Unity of the Faith,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.20. Eph. 4.14.</note> and Knowledg of the Son of God unto a perfect Man.</p>
                     <p>And we may further obſerve, That in writing this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> it is manifeſt from the Inſcription thereof, that <hi>Timothy</hi> therein joined with S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Now, though he was no Apoſtle, nor a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of St. <hi>Paul</hi> till after the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as appears from the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts;</hi> yet he here, as well as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> hath a ſhare in the Miniſtry of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Timothy</hi> was the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared by the Ancient Writers. <hi>Euſebius</hi> atteſteth it;<note place="margin">Euſ. Hiſt. l. 3. c. 4.</note> and beſides others, this was expreſſed by <hi>Leontius</hi> in the
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:170758:281"/>great Council of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Conc. Chalc. Action. 11.</note> there being then preſerved an exact Record and Catalogue of the Biſhops of that Church. And though Learned Men herein diſagree, and there is manifeſt difficulty in fixing the Chronology; it is greatly probable, from comparing the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> with the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that he was not yet made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when this Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was written: And this might then give ſome fair probability from the inſtance of <hi>Timothy,</hi> that that Order of Prieſt or Presbyter, as diſtinct from a Biſhop, was of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical, and therefore a Divine Original. But becauſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral difficulties, too large to be here diſcuſſed, muſt be obviated for the clearing this particular; I ſhall rather fix upon another Conſideration, which may be ſufficient to perſwade the ſame.</p>
                     <p>It is very evident from the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and ſome expreſſions in the Epiſtles; that for ſeveral years after the famous Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was founded by St. <hi>Paul, Timothy</hi> the firſt Biſhop there, was uſually with St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Journeys, or by his Command in other places. Now it may be acknowledged, that the chief Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and power of Cenſure in ſeveral Churches, was for ſome time reſerved in the hands of the Apoſtles themſelves, though at a diſtance, as is evident from the Epiſtles to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> it was concerning the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> But he who ſhall think that in all this time they had no Church-Officer fixed amongſt them in that great Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> to adminiſter the Holy Communion, and celebrate other needful Miniſterial Performances, muſt account the Apoſtles to have had no great care of the Churches they planted, nor the Churches to have had any great zeal for the Religion they embraced, which no Man can judg, who hath any knowledg of the Spirit of that Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. But if they had in the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> other fixed Officers diſtinct from the Biſhop, to celebrate the Holy Communion, and other neceſſary acts of ordinary Miniſtration, then muſt the Order of Presbyters be of as
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:170758:281"/>early original in the Church, as the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts;</hi> and then the ordaining Elders in every Church, muſt take in thoſe who are diſtinctly called Prieſts or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>To this I add, that the Office of Presbyter includeth an Authority to tender in God's Name remiſſion of Sins, and as from him to exhibit to his Church the Sacramental Symbols of his Grace; and upon that account no ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice could ever have its Original from any lower than Apoſtolical and Divine Authority.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To us, in different Ranks and Orders in the Church, not in a parity and equality. Here is S. <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle, and <hi>Timothy</hi> in an Order inferiour to him. When Chriſt was upon Earth, he appointed the Apoſtles, and the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and when he Aſcended, he gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors and Teachers. And though moſt of theſe were Officers by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Commiſſion, which are ceaſed; yet when <hi>Timothy</hi> was fixed at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where there then were Presbyters, as I have ſhewed, the chief power of Government, and the care of Ordination was intruſted in his hands ſingly, as is manifeſt, and hath been oft obſerved from the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to <hi>Timothy.</hi> The like appears concerning <hi>Titus;</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that the chief care of the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> was in the hands of the Angels of thoſe Churches.</p>
                     <p>If we conſult the Ancient ſtate of the Church, this chief Government in a ſingle Perſon or Biſhop, in thoſe ancient times, took place as far as Chriſtianity it ſelf reached. Beſides what may be ſaid from particular Writers,<note place="margin">1 Can. Ap. 2. Can. Nic. 19.</note> the firſt General Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the more ancient Code cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Canons of the Apoſtles, do both of them not only frequently mention, as diſtinct Offices, the Biſhop, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Deacon; but alſo expreſs this diſtinction between Biſhop, and Preſbyter. 1.<note place="margin">2 Can.

                     <p>Now this Obſervation ſhews the diſtinction of theſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Chriſtian Church,<note place="margin">Euſeb. HIſt. l. 2. c. 1. Hieron. de ſcript. Eccleſ.</note> from the very beginning thereof, St. <hi>James</hi> being ordained Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoon after our Saviour's Aſcenſion. And this will further evidence, that as the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers frequently mention the Officers of the Temple-Service, only by the names of <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> including therein the High-Prieſt, whoſe Office was diſtinct from the other Prieſts; ſo it is no prejudice to the like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Offices under the New Teſtament, that in the Scriptures and ſome other ancient Writers, the Officers above Deacons are ſometimes expreſſed by the name of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, ſometime of Elders, Prieſts or Presbyters; whilſt yet we have very plain Teſtimony of the ſingular emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of one, who hath ſince been peculiarly called the Biſhop.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the laſt thing to be diſcourſed of, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority by which this Miniſtry is eſtabliſhed. God in Chriſt hath given to us the Miniſtry of Reconciliation; and this ſpeaketh three things.</p>
                     <pb n="546" facs="tcp:170758:283"/>
                     <p n="1">1. The true Original of this Function. God the Father gave the Miniſtry of Reconciliation; our Lord ſent his Apoſtles, as his Father ſent him; and the Holy Ghoſt made the Elders of <hi>Epheſus</hi> to be Overſeers of the Flock. And here not only St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was called immediately, but <hi>Timothy</hi> alſo (even as thoſe other Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>) being called by Men, whom God made chief Officers in his Church, received this Miniſtry by Divine Authority; and therefore the Adminiſtrations thereof are performed in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>This therefore is ſuch a Sanction, as every Perſon upon Earth ought to reverence; and whoſoever either deſpiſe or oppoſe this Miniſtry, had need ſeriouſly and timely to conſider whoſe Authority they undertake to affront. When our Saviour appointed the Twelve Apoſtles, and afterwards the Seventy,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.15. Luke 10, 12.</note> he bids them both to ſhake off the Duſt of their Feet againſt that City that ſhould not receive them; and tells them it ſhall be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> in that day, than for that City; and declares further even to the Seventy, who were then of the loweſt rank of them whom he ſent:<note place="margin">Luke 10.16.</note> 
                        <hi>he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But for all thoſe who are employed about God's Work, and are warranted by his Authority; if they be faithful in his Service,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.4.</note> they ſhall be here under his Care, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after partakers of his Reward. St. <hi>Peter</hi> acquaints us, that when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, they ſhall receive <hi>a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. l. 16, 20. ch. 2. l.</note> and St. <hi>John</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, <hi>That our Lord himſelf holdeth the ſeven Stars, or the Angels of the ſeven Churches in his right hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. This ſpeaks alſo the Excellency of this Miniſtry. As it is from God, it is properly and eminently a Gift of God, even a Gift of that high Nature, that when Chriſt in his glorious Exaltation received Gifts for Men, he then gave ſome Paſtors and Teachers,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> and as Head of his Church, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:170758:283"/>this fixed Miniſtry. And if we conſider it as it reſpects Men, the moſt excellent Deſigns are thereby pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, to wit, the promoting among Men the Glory of God, and the Kingdom and Government of Jeſus Chriſt; and the conducting Men into the Ways of God, and thereby unto Peace and Reconciliation with him, and to everlaſting Happineſs. Hereupon they who ſerve God in this Office,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.9. 2 Cor. 6.1.</note> are owned to be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Fellow-workers with God himſelf, as under God, carrying on the great Deſign of God and his Goodneſs in the World. And this ſpeaks it an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of great Value, Worth, and Honour.</p>
                     <p>And as I above noted this Miniſtry to excell the Jewiſh Prieſthood, which yet was very excellent; ſo St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerves, That God hath given this high Honour thereto,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. de Sacerdot. l. 3. c. 5.</note> which he hath not given to the holy Angels and Archangels themſelves, to be Miniſters of Reconciliation, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe in his Name the Pledges of his Grace and Favour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Members of his Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This ſheweth that no Man may take this Honour unto himſelf, but he that entreth into any Order of this Miniſtry, muſt do it in that way which God appointeth. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were conſtituted and commiſſionated immediatly by Chriſt himſelf; and as he committed the general Care of his Church to them, he therewith endued them with a Power to ordain others, which is a chief part of that Care, and of great concernment for the preſent and future Good of the Church.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſiſtants of the Apoſtles, and the firſt Biſhops and other Officers of the ſeveral Churches, were ordained by ſome one or more of the Apoſtles, or of thoſe Apoſtolical Men who received Ordination from them. The ancient Teſtimonies of the Fathers aſſure us,<note place="margin">Tert. de Praeſc. c. 32. Iren l. 3. c. 3. Euſ. Hiſt. Eccl. l. 3. c. 35. gr. Acts 6.3, 6. Acts 14.23. Euſ. Hiſt. l. 3. c. 23. gr.</note> that <hi>Clemens</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Polycarp</hi> by St. <hi>John.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures acquaint us, that the ſeven Deacons were conſtituted by the twelve Apoſtles; and where <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> came, they ordained Elders in every Church. And <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> declares, as a Matter of certain Truth, that St. <hi>John</hi> in
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:170758:284"/>his old Age, in ſome places made Biſhops, and in others planted whole Churches.</p>
                     <p>After the Apoſtles had committed particular Churches to the Care of their Biſhops or Metropolitans, they alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted the Power of Ordination peculiarly in their hands, which indeed is included in committing to them the chief Care of the Church.<note place="margin">Titus 1.5. 1 Tim. 3. 1-14, 15.</note> To this purpoſe <hi>Titus</hi> was appointed to ordain Elders in every City of <hi>Crete;</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected how he ought to behave himſelf in the Church of God, concerning the Ordination of its Officers. And from theſe Principles, the Truth of what <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth may be eaſily inferred,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Cor. p. 57.</note> That the Apoſtles ordered that when thoſe chief Officers of the Church, whom they had appointed, ſhould die, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, others in their places ſhould ſucceed them in the ſame Office and Miniſtration, and therefore with a Power of Ordination.</p>
                     <p>And the univerſal Conſent of genuine Antiquity, ſhews the ancient <hi>Church</hi> to have received and followed that Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and Model which was framed by the Apoſtles, for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Eminency in Government, and Power in Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To this purpoſe both <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> urge this,<note place="margin">Tert. de Praeſc. c. 32. Iren. adv. Haer. l. 3. c. 3.</note> as a convictive Argument againſt the later Brood of Hereſies, That the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> could produce ſuch a Catalogue of their Biſhops, and the Succeſſion of them, which would manifeſt that the firſt of them who was fixed in their ſeveral <hi>Churches,</hi> was there placed by the Apoſtles themſelves, or by Apoſtolical Men their Aſſiſtants. And the Succeſſion in divers chief <hi>Churches</hi> is ſtill preſerved in ancient Writers, and Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians. And that the Power of Ordination eſpecially was peculiar to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, beſides the Teſtimony of ancient <hi>Canons,</hi> and Practice, is acknowledged even by St. <hi>Hierom.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hieron. ad Evagr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </note> And the placing of this Power in a ſingle Perſon was of great neceſſity and uſefulneſs, for preſerving the <hi>Churches</hi> Peace and Unity.</p>
                     <p>From hence I conclude, that Epiſcopal Ordination was, according to the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the Apoſtles, and conſtant
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:170758:284"/>Practice of the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> the only regular way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into this Office and Miniſtry of Reconciliation: and he that knows how eaſy a thing it is to raiſe plauſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections almoſt againſt any thing, will not be much moved by ſuch as ſome produce in this caſe, againſt ſo plain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and general Teſtimony.</p>
                     <p>Indeed there have been ſome, and but ſome Proteſtant Foreign <hi>Churches,</hi> (not the <hi>Bohemian,</hi> as ſome Engliſh Writers have unfaithfully miſrepreſented it, nor thoſe of <hi>Sueden,</hi> and the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Dominions, nor divers others in <hi>Germany,</hi>) who have been without this Epiſcopal Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it muſt be ſaid, that in this particular, which is a matter of moment, they are defective in that Primitive Apoſtolical Order which we obſerve. But in the firſt fixing theſe <hi>Churches,</hi> and their Miniſtry, all things ſeem not to have been done as they would have choſen, but as their preſent Circumſtances would give them leave, while they wanted that Privilege which our Reformation enjoyed, the Conſent of the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Governors. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Expreſſions of particular Writers, the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, in their <hi>General Confeſſion,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Confeſ. Gallic. c. 31.</note> concerning the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Miniſtry, pleaded a Neceſſity in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, of having ſome things done <hi>extra ordinem,</hi> out of the regular Way, with reſpect to the making up the Ruines and Decays of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Yea, thoſe Churches themſelves, and the moſt worthy Men among them, are no Oppoſers, but Approvers of this Government and Order, as hath been ſufficiently ſhewed concerning many principal Perſons among them. And even in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> when thoſe ſent from <hi>England</hi> aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Epiſcopacy as Apoſtolical, there was not (as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in their joint Atteſtation) any one Perſon in that Synod, who ſpake a Word againſt it; yea, as Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> acquaints us, the Preſident of the Synod ſaid, <hi>Domine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Divine Right of Epiſcopacy, part 1. c. 4.</note>

                     <pb n="550" facs="tcp:170758:285"/>
                     <p>Now I conceive, it becomes private Perſons not to be over forward in judging other <hi>Churches,</hi> but to expreſs as much Charity towards them as the caſe will bear; but to ſhew no ſuch reſpect to any, as to neglect a due Reverence to whatſoever is of God. Wherefore I ſhall only note three things in general.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it is indeed a Truth, that ſome poſitive Precepts may in extraordinary caſes be diſpenſed with by the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, who will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice. This was that which warranted <hi>David</hi>'s Men in eating the Shew-Bread. In this caſe Circumciſion was forborn in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Caſuiſts thought that Precept not to oblige,<note place="margin">Hor. Hebr. in 1 Cor. 7.19.</note> when the circumciſing an Infant was inevitably like to procure his Death. The ſacrificing in another place than that which God had ſingly appointed, was practiſed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> as well as others, after the Deſtruction of <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh,</hi> and before the Building of the Temple; and by <hi>Elijah,</hi> under the general Defection of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating Baptiſm by Perſons unordained, was allowed in the ancient Church,<note place="margin">Hieron. adv. Lucif.</note> 
                        <hi>ſi neceſſitas cogit,</hi> as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> phraſeth it. And the Command that all the Males of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould three times in the Year appear before the Lord, doth yet by the Letter of the Scripture give allowance to him who was in a Journey, and by the reaſonable Interpretation of the Jewiſh Writers,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.21. V. Seld. de Syn. l. 1. c. 7. p. 186, 187.</note> the ſame Liberty was to be extended to thoſe in Childhood and Infancy, (as <hi>Samuel</hi> was) and to thoſe in Sickneſs, Old-Age, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Yet it becomes all good Men, who are to obey God, and reverence his Inſtitutions, not to be forward in judging themſelves diſobliged, by the appearance of ſuch Caſes as they account extraordinary, from Obedience to any of his Rules of Order. When <hi>Saul</hi> thought he had a Caſe of Neceſſity to warrant his Sacrificing, yet God was highly diſpleaſed therewith, and deprived him of his Kingdom: Nor might <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> touch the ſhaking Ark.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In ordinary caſes, he who willingly breaks poſitive Rules eſtabliſhed by God's Authority, is guilty of heinous
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:170758:285"/>moral Evil, in diſobedience to God's Commands, contempt of his Government, and deſpiſing the Bleſſings which he tenders by thoſe Inſtitutions.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore ſince Epiſcopal Ordination hath been of ſo general Practice, from the Apoſtles, in the Church of God, and is regularly eſtabliſhed and continued in this Kingdom, no Man in this Church, with reſpect to Order, Unity, and Apoſtolical Inſtitution, can reaſonably expect that God will ever own him as his Officer in the Miniſtry of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſs he be admitted thereto by ſuch Ordination. And private Chriſtians, both out of Duty to God, and out of reſpect to their own Safety, may not ſo eſteem of any who oppoſe themſelves againſt this Order, becauſe of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger under the New Teſtament, of periſhing in the gainſaying of <hi>Core.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And let every Perſon, whoſoever he be, be wary how upon any pretence whatſoever he undertakes to execute any proper part of the Power of the Keys, unleſs he be ſet apart thereunto by regular Ordination.</p>
                     <p>And now I ſhall conclude my Diſcourſe with three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
                     <p>Firſt; This gives us an account whence all that Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and Difficulty doth ariſe, which the Miniſtration of the Goſpel, and the faithful Servants of God therein do meet with. The Devil will uſe his utmoſt Power, by all his Methods, to hinder ſo good a Work as this Miniſtration is intended for. Hence the Holy Jeſus, and moſt of his Apoſtles, met with oppoſition even unto Death. And as all the Perſecutions of the Chriſtian Church had an eſpecial eye upon the Clergy, ſo that violent one under <hi>Diocleſian,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Euſ. Hiſt. l. 3. c. 12.</note> for the firſt Year, fingled them only out to be the Subjects of his Fury. Theſe are the ordinary Mark, againſt whom all the Churches Enemies ſhoot their poyſoned Arrows, enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed from the Malignity of the Old Serpent.</p>

                     <p>And when the Evil One cannot proceed by open Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he oft makes uſe of Inſtruments to fix ſlanderous Cenſures and Calumnies upon the Officers of Chriſt, to render their Miniſtration the leſs proſperous and ſucceſsful in the World: Inſomuch that their Devoutneſs in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is by ſome upbraided with Ceremoniouſneſs; and their conſciencious Obſervance of due Order, and Averſeneſs to Faction, is branded with the odious Term of Popery; and their embracing the neceſſary Reformation of the Church, is by others ſtigmatized with the infamous Names of Hereſy and Schiſm. Thus our Saviour was called <hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub,</hi> himſelf accuſed of Blaſphemy, and his Doctrine of Hereſy.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe things, the vicious and ſcandalous Practices of too many who profeſs the Truth, the various Schiſms, and other manifold Corruptions in the Doctrine and Practice of Religion; and I wiſh I might not add the undue Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of ſome Patrons in conferring Eccleſiaſtical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, are all of them dangerous Methods, made uſe of by the Evil One, to hinder the attaining the great Ends of this Miniſtration.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; I now addreſs my ſelf to you, my Reverend Brethren. It is a weighty Charge, a Buſineſs of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that we are called unto; and as we are Stewards of the Living God, it is required of us that we be found faithful. And for the putting us in mind of that ſerious Care and Diligence which we are to uſe in our Miniſtry, I know not how to ſpeak otherwiſe ſo well, as by recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the ſerious and frequent conſidering that uſeful Exhortation in the Book of Ordination.</p>
                     <p>And let us particularly look well to our own Paths; for tho the Excellency of God's Ordinances doth not depend upon the Inſtruments, yet if a Blemiſh appears in any of our Lives, it becomes a great Prejudice to the Deſigns we ſhould carry on among Men, and will open the Mouths of our Enemies; and if there be a <hi>Judas</hi> among the Apoſtles,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:170758:286"/>the Devil is ready to make a ſpecial uſe of him to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. But let us obſerve that Rule, which but a few Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes after my Text, the Apoſtle tells us was the Practice of himſelf, and other Officers of the Chriſtian Church, <hi>Giving no Offence in any thing, that the Miniſtry be not blamed, but in all things approving our ſelves as the Ministers of God.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.3, 4.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly; Let every one in their places lay to their help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Hand, to promote the Succeſs of this Miniſtry upon themſelves and others. Wherefore let every Man who lives under the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, reject all Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs of Life, and exerciſe himſelf unto Godlineſs; and ſo he will certainly advantage himſelf, and probably others by his good Example.</p>
                     <p>And let all thoſe who have the management of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church in their hands, indifferently check the Neglect and Contempt of the Publick Service of God, and all other Viciouſneſs and Evil which comes within the Limits of their Authority, and countenance and encourage all real Vertue, Goodneſs, Holineſs, and Religion.</p>
                     <p>And thoſe Pariſh-Officers, who ſtand charged upon their Oaths to give an account of Offences, which is noted by our <hi>26th</hi> Canon, to be the chief Means whereby publick Offences may be reformed and puniſhed, and whoſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage is there ſeverely cenſured; let not them ſinfully neglect their Oath and their Duty, the right Diſcharge of which may tend to the Glory of God, the flouriſhing of the Church and Religion, and the bringing Men into the Ways of Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe the Apoſtle propoſeth that humbling Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion concerning the Miniſterial Charge, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe Things?</hi> Let us earneſtly implore the Help and Grace of God to aſſiſt us, and ſucceed our Miniſtrations to
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:170758:287"/>the great Good of Men. And let every devout Chriſtian join his fervent and frequent Prayer to this end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, That he who hath committed to us this Miniſtration, would bring all thoſe who partake thereof, unto true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life here, and eternal Happineſs hereafter, through the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: To whom, with the Father and the Holy-Ghoſt, be all Glory for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>IN the foregoing part of this Prophecy there is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal appearance of things concerning <hi>Judah,</hi> a heavy threatning of ſad Calamities therein, both by Famine and Sword, in the firſt Chapter and former part of the ſecond. The dreadfulneſs hereof is repreſented according to an uſual Prophetick Style, as if God was making the whole Fabrick of his Creation to totter; <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>The Earth ſhall quake before them, and the Heavens ſhall tremble, the Sun and Moon
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:170758:288"/>ſhall be dark, and the Stars ſhall withdraw their ſhining.</hi> And this great Calamity was like to be the more ſad, becauſe of the terror of God's Vengeance going along with it, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>The Day of the Lord is great and very terrible, and who can abide it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſuch a caſe as this, theſe words (which our Church di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth to be read at the beginning of <hi>Lent,</hi> which is now near, and which are of excellent uſe at all times,) are the beginning of the Prophetical Direction for their help and recovery from this ſad Condition; and ſuch a Remedy as recovereth one gaſping for Life, is worth the valuing. Now here upon the firſt mention of returning to God, are ſome overtures of hope, <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>He is gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> v. 14. <hi>Who knows if he will return and repent?</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the continuance of ſolemn and ſerious Devotion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the following Verſes, we have a plain and clear promiſe of help, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>Then will the Lord he jealous for his Land, and pity his People.</hi> So excellent and efficacious a preſcription is true Repentance and returning to God, that upon this the Scene of affairs is preſently changed. And whereas all that part of this Prophecy which goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Text, contained doleful and heavy Judgments: From this Verſe forward there are great Bleſſings and Comforts promiſed to <hi>Judah,</hi> and Judgments denounced againſt her Enemies, even unto the end of this whole Prophecy. Thus hereby the dark Night endeth in the appearance of a bright Day; and the ſtormy Tempeſt is blown over, and behold a Calm.</p>
                     <p>In theſe words we have,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Authority by which they are commanded, <hi>Therefore alſo now ſaith the Lord.</hi> So that we have here a Divine Law and Precept, even with reſpect to theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Circumſtances, which had a terrible Aſpect: But how ſad ſoever they were, God himſelf directs to a way of help. There is no ſtate, how perplexed and uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:170758:288"/>ſoever in this World, but which is intended of God to deter Men from Sin. Even in the ſevereſt threatnings of God's Wrath and Anger there is, as <hi>Cl. Alexandrinus</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a kindneſs and love to Men, by ſuch Threatnings to reclaim them from their Sin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them from the Paths of Ruine. And this Phraſe, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo now ſaith the Lord,</hi> doth alſo give notice of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what remarkable which followeth, which requireth our ſpecial attention and diligent obſervation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The chief thing here expreſſed, is, the Precept or uſeful Direction it ſelf; <hi>Turn ye even unto me with all your heart.</hi> This I ſhall inſiſt upon, and thence ſhall undertake to ſhew,</p>
                     <p>That Pious and Penitent behaviour towards God, and hearty turning to him, is always uſeful, and is the beſt way for remedy under the greateſt difficulties. And of this I ſhall diſcourſe (as the nature of the ſubject requireth,) with the greateſt plainneſs and evidence that I can. The Duty here enjoined, is of great concernment and uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: To a Man's ſelf, a quickned and renewed exerciſe of his Duty brings inward Peace, intitles him to the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Favour of God, and the Rewards of his Kingdom. The ſtate of the World, and of the Church is ſuch, That many Men know not whither to look or turn; and then the moſt uſeful and neceſſary undertaking is, to direct their eyes to God, and turn unto him. Other acts of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent care are in their places needful alſo; but there is no true Prudence in the neglect of this which is of greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Prodigal Son in his ſtraits could take no wiſer courſe than to bethink himſelf, and return to his Father; and thereby he takes the beſt care of his Duty and his Welfare both together. And this true penitent application to God, is the ſure and only way to obtain his favour. <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Turn ye unto me, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, and I will turn unto you, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="558" facs="tcp:170758:289"/>
                     <p>In ſpeaking to this Duty, I ſhall enquire into theſe two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. What Encouragements have we for obtaining good fr om God by our hearty turning to him?</p>
                     <p n="2">II. What is it to turn to God with all our heart; or what muſt be done by us for the right performing this Duty?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. What Encouragements have we that we may receive good from God by hearty turning to him? This enquiry is ſutable to the deſign and occaſion of my Text, theſe words being propoſed as a way for receiving help and good. This alſo is of great uſe with reſpect to the Duty it ſelf; ſince Men are not forward to undertake things which they think will be to no purpoſe, and will tend to no advantage. And this alſo is needful with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the general ſtate of Religion; ſince he that cometh to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him. Wherefore I ſhall here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the more general encouragement we have to turn to God, from the nature of God himſelf; and then the particular encouragements from the ſtate and nature of Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p>Among the various Encouragements from the Nature and Being of God, I ſhall only mention two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God's Supreme Government and Authority. Upon this account his favour is highly valuable, becauſe he diſpoſeth of all the great Affairs and Concerns of Men. For he orders the final Judgment which concerns the eternal ſtate of Men; and this will proceed according to the Rules of Righteouſneſs and the New-Covenant, and according to the Sentence which will then be pronounced, muſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man's endleſs Condition be. But with reſpect to that Day, thoſe who are hard and impenitent do treaſure up Wrath againſt the day of Wrath; but thoſe who turn unto
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:170758:289"/>God, ſhall inherit Life: And God ſo diſpoſeth of all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publick Affairs in this World, that thereupon it is of great concernment to have him well-pleaſed with us. And if a gracious Prince ſtanding by his faithful Subject, or a righteous Judg taking in with an honeſt and juſt Cauſe, be the Advantage of thoſe who are concerned therein; much more is the Kindneſs and Care of God greatly valuable: For no Evil befalls any without his hand, nor are there any publick Calamities but ſuch as are his Judgments. He can, and oft doth defeat the Counſels of Men, and diſcover their ſecret Contrivances; and he governs them and their Actions, and the Events thereof. Herein we have hitherto had cauſe to admire the Goodneſs and Wiſdom of God, and his Counſel ſhall ſtand.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Goodneſs and Purity of his Nature. This ſhews his great readineſs to expreſs his Favour to them who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily turn to him. The Order and Beauty of the Creation, and the conſtant and abundant Supplies of Providence, are Evidences of God's great Bounty, and Readineſs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate of his Goodneſs to his Creatures. The Light of this World is not ſo diffuſive of it ſelf, as the Goodneſs of God is, ſince from him, as the Father of Lights, cometh every good Gift. But that Purity (which the Perfection of the Divine Being doth aſſure us to be in God, and which even our own Conſciences muſt alſo acknowledg) ſpeaks Goodneſs and Piety to be acceptable to God, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are exerciſed therein to be peculiarly the Objects of his Favour. And as he is a Governour, Obedience and Reverence muſt be both due to him, and pleaſing in his ſight. And indeed no good Man is ſo highly pleaſed with Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Seriouſneſs, as the holy God is; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his whole Creation that he eſteems ſo much. He hath ſaid, <hi>Heaven is my Throne, and Earth is my Footſtool; but to this Man will I look, that is poor, and of a contrite Spirit.</hi> Iſa. 66.1, 2. Now upon this conſideration of the Divine Goodneſs, the <hi>Ninevites</hi> proceeded in their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and tho that was undertaken upon uncertain hopes,
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:170758:290"/>yet with good ſucceſs. But we have plain Promiſes and Directions to our Duty, and as plain Promiſes annexed thereunto, ſuch as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.20. <hi>I will judg you, O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>every one according to his Ways, ſaith the Lord God. 'Repent, and turn your ſelves from all your Tranſgreſſions, ſo Iniquity ſhall not be your Ruine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I come now to conſider ſome peculiar Encouragements from Chriſtianity, and ſhall here mention three.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the coming of the Son of God into the World. He came to be a Mediator, and a Sacrifice, and to aſſure us, that God is ready to be reconciled to all them that turn to him, and entertain the Terms of his Covenant. And therefore thoſe who are truly penitent, ſhall by virtue of the Death and Sacrifice of Chriſt, and the Reconciliation he hath thereby made, obtain the Favour of God. This was ſo much deſigned by our Saviour, that Repentance was one of the firſt things he preached, Mat. 4.17. <hi>Jeſus began to preach, and to ſay, Repent.</hi> And among the laſt Things which he committed to his Apoſtles before his Aſcenſion, this was one, <hi>That Repentance, and Remiſſion of Sins, ſhould be preached in his Name among all Nations.</hi> Luke 24.47. And is it not our great Comfort, that the Encouragements to true Repentance are aſſured by the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and by the Death of Chriſt, and that they are confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by both the Sacraments of the New Teſtament? If God had not been willing to receive humble Penitents, and to give them his Bleſſings, would he have ſent his Son, and have given ſo great a Bleſſing to the World, as to put us upon returning to him? And if Chriſt came to call Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Repentance, will he not own and receive them who obey his Call? It is true indeed, that the Propoſals of the Goſpel do chiefly relate to God's beſtowing ſpiritual and eternal Bleſſings (and our Care ſhould be eſpecially about theſe things) but even temporal Bleſſings are not excluded from the Promiſes of God.</p>
                     <pb n="561" facs="tcp:170758:290"/>
                     <p n="2">2. From the Glory of Chriſt's Exaltation. He who upon Earth propoſed the Grace and Doctrine of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, hath now in Heaven all Authority and Power to diſpenſe the Bleſſings he promiſed to them who obey him. And he is faithful and true to perform his Word. Would you obtain Remiſſion of Sin, and the Favour of God? He, as our High-Prieſt, is our Interceſſor, effectually to procure this Bleſſing from God for them who heartily turn to him. And as our King, he is himſelf empowered to diſpenſe this Favour of God; <hi>For God hath exalted him to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi> Acts 5.31. And he who took ſo much pains to ſeek after the ſtraying Sheep, will no doubt embrace them who by his care do return. If you ſeek for the Welfare and Preſervation of the Church of God, and its being defended againſt its Enemies; as humble pious Chriſtians are the Heirs of Promiſe, theſe Bleſſings are the Benefits contained in the Covenant and Promiſe of God. And withal, there are ſpecial Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements from our Saviour's Exaltation, for our expecting to receive theſe Mercies: For our Saviour being exalted at God's right-hand, is now made an Head over all things to the Church; and this includes both his near Relation which he beareth to it, and that alſo he taketh upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a very particular Care of it. And his Exaltation is ſo fatal to his and his Churches Enemies, that he muſt reign till all his Enemies be made his Footſtool. Hereupon he tells <hi>Saul,</hi> going to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> that <hi>it was hard for him to kick against the Pricks.</hi> His Enemies muſt fall before his Power, but he will effect what he undertakes to uphold.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From the more particular Conſideration of the State of the Goſpel-Church. The Chriſtian Church is made up of returning Penitents, but theſe are owned of God as his Children and Heirs, and they ſhall ſhine as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father. And ſuch is God's Care of this Society of his Church, that if it walk in his Way, it ſhall be ſupported by him, tho Earth and Hell ſhould contrive againſt it. Yet no particular Branch or Part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:170758:291"/>Church hath any ſecurity of its ſtanding, or any aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from God that it ſhall be preſerved, but upon the Conditions of its holding the Faith, and practiſing Piety and Obedience, or hearty Repentance. And indeed it can have none, becauſe there can be no particular Promiſe from God againſt the Nature and Terms of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which enjoins Faith and Obedience as neceſſary Conditions of Acceptance with God.</p>
                     <p>The Romiſh Church pretends that ſhe can never fall, but muſt always continue, becauſe of that Promiſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>On this Rock I will build my Church.</hi> But to this all I ſhall ſay at this time, is, That theſe Words do no way particularly refer to the Roman Church, as it would arrogate to it ſelf. And our Lord hath plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to us, that no Church or Perſons whatſoever can be repreſented by a Houſe built upon a Rock, which will ſtand notwithſtanding all Oppoſitions, but thoſe who hear and obey his Doctrine, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not. But all who neglect this Faith and Practice, are as thoſe who build on the Sand; their Houſe will fall, and great will be the Fall thereof. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.24, 25, 26, 27. And that there was no particular Privilege of this Nature ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be granted to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is further manifeſt from that Epiſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the <hi>Romans:</hi> For with ſome particular reſpect to that Church, he lets them know, <hi>If God ſpared not the natural Branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee; and if thou continue not in his Goodneſs, thou alſo ſhalt be cut off;</hi> Rom. 11.21, 22. But all particular Churches whatſoever, who heartily obey the Doctrine of the Goſpel, are ſecured of God's eſpecial Care and Preſervation from thoſe Words of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 15.2. <hi>Every Branch in me that beareth Fruit, my Father pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it, that it may bring forth more Fruit.</hi> The fruitful part of his Vineyard will not want his Care.</p>
                     <p>And it is our great Comfort, that God's Catholick Church ſtands by his Foundation upon a Rock, ſo that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it, or no kind of Deſtruction
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:170758:291"/>ſhall be able to overcome it. So that whatever Enemies it hath in the World, they, like the proud and mighty Waves, if they daſh themſelves againſt the Rock, will be broken in pieces; but the Rock it ſelf, and that which is built upon it, as an impregnable Fortreſs, ſtandeth firm. For the Comfort of the Primitive Chriſtians, the Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> gave them aſſurance, that God would take care that his Church ſhould not be overwhelmed by the Perſecutions it endured, but ſhould prevail under them. And if it had not been from the Support of the Power of God, the Chriſtian Church in its weakeſt Eſtate could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſtood againſt the Wiſdom and Power of the World, which was then engaged againſt it; but God then did, and yet will uphold his Church even to the end. And with a particular eye to God's eſpecial Care hereof in theſe latter Times, we read, that when the Thouſand Years were ended, and the Nations, and <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> compaſſed the Camp of the Saints, and the beloved City, then <hi>Fire came from God out of Heaven, and devoured them,</hi> Rev. 20.8, 9. And thoſe Interpreters, who would underſtand theſe Phraſes of the <hi>Camp of the Saints,</hi> and the <hi>Beloved City,</hi> concerning any particular City or Place upon Earth, ſeem not herein to obſerve the Nature of the Prophetick Style, which will direct us to underſtand it of the more eminent and chief part of the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore we have great grounds for expecting Good from God, if we mind our Duty to him. Now upon this Encouragement, let us in the Fear of God undertake this Duty, that we may be inſtrumental to the procuring Good to the Church of God, and that we our ſelves may be Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of eternal Happineſs. This is the way to have God to be our Friend; and no other Peace in the World can be concluded and ſecured upon thoſe advantagious Terms, as our having Peace with God may be. And therefore I ſhall now come to the ſecond thing I propoſed to diſcourſe of, what we are here commanded to do.</p>
                     <pb n="564" facs="tcp:170758:292"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What is it to turn to God with all our Heart?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is one and the ſame thing with Repentance. The Septuagint expreſs this Phraſe of <hi>Turning</hi> in the Text by <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p n="1">1. A ſerious Conſideration and minding of our Rule, together with the Motives that ſhould put us upon a Practice anſwerable thereto. This Rule is the Word of God, or the Holy Scripture, as ſuperadded to the natural Light of Reaſon and Conſcience. Upon due pondering of this, <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s Heart was tender, and he humbled himſelf, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook a Reformation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Self-reflection and Examination of our Minds, Ways, and Actions by this Rule, with this ſtedfaſt purpoſe, that nothing may be entertained or allowed in us, which is not agreeable thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. An humble and ſerious Sorrow for paſt Miſcarriages, with hearty and unfeigned Confeſſion of Sin, and earneſt Supplication to God for the obtaining Mercy.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A reſolved undertaking to forſake all Evil in Heart and Life, and to do our Duty.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things are ſo plain in the Nature of them, and ſo evidently neceſſary in their general Conſideration, that they need not either further Explication or Proof. The Practice and Exerciſe of Repentance, and turning to God, taketh in all theſe; but both the Phraſe of <hi>Turning,</hi> and the chief Deſign of Repentance hath principal reſpect to the laſt of them, it being all one to turn to God, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to, and carefully ſet upon our Duty. And therefore I ſhall now inſiſt on this; and that we may practiſe theſe things to good effect, I ſhall urge ſome particular Inſtances, which are of great uſe to be performed in our minding this Duty.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In avoiding Schiſms and Diviſions, and practiſing Unity and Peace.</p>
                     <pb n="565" facs="tcp:170758:292"/>
                     <p n="2">2. In the forſaking Debauchery and Profaneneſs, and the embracing Seriouſneſs and Sobriety.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In rejecting all Irreligion, and Neglect of the Worſhip of God, and engaging our ſelves in true Piety and hearty Devotion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the avoiding Schiſms and Diviſions, and practiſing Unity and Peace. How many and frequent are the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts for Peace and Unity delivered in the Doctrine of our Saviour? and how earneſtly is this urged and inculcated? <hi>If there be any Conſolation in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. (ſaith the Apoſtle, Phil. 2.1, 2.) <hi>Fulfill ye my Joy, being of one accord, and of one mind.</hi> And if we view and conſider the Buſineſs of our Religion, as it was delivered by our Saviour and his Apoſtles, this will be found to be one of its great and weighty Precepts. And ſhall we then be forward to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about other leſſer things, to the neglect of this? As the Scribes and Phariſees would tithe <hi>Mint, Aniſe, and Cummin,</hi> but neglected <hi>the weighty Things of God's Law.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>The Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink, but Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy-Ghoſt: For he that in theſe Things ſerveth Chriſt, is acceptable to God, and approved of Men.</hi> Rom. 14.17, 18. In which Words it is very plainly aſſerted, that whilſt ſome other Things which Men may contend about, are of leſs moment, theſe Things here mentioned are of great concernment to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it ſelf, and the being eſteemed of God and good Men. And as Peace is one of theſe great Duties here urged, ſo that the Apoſtle had a very particular Eye thereupon, may be concluded from the Words immediatly following, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Let us therefore follow after the Things which make for Peace.</hi> And the Neglect of this Duty is very hurtful and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Chriſtian Church: For as in the Body, when it is rent and torn, and the Members disjointed, there muſt be from this very Cauſe great Diſorders, Weakneſs, and Feebleneſs; ſo is it alſo in the Church of God. Yea, theſe Things are to be accounted of dangerous Conſequence, for
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:170758:293"/>the undermining or ſhaking the Kingdom of Chriſt, ſince our Lord himſelf hath told us, <hi>that a Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf, is brought to Deſolation.</hi> And ſhall any good Man be pleaſed to join with the Enemy in his Deſigns againſt the welfare, ſtability and ſafety of the Church of Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>Now, beſides many other Arguments which might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, to diſſwade from Schiſms and Diviſions, there are two things I ſhall recommend to you, as being well worthy your ſerious conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, making Diviſions in the Church, either includes a total want, or at leaſt a defect in a great degree of the true Spirit of Chriſtianity: This muſt needs be ſo, becauſe the obſerving Peace and Unity are ſo great a part and duty of our Religion. If we reflect on our Baptiſm, we are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into one Body, and therefore are to obſerve Unity. And when S. <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to take care of that great Duty, of <hi>walking worthy of that Vocation wherewith they were called,</hi> Eph. 4.1. To that end he moſt particularly and largely inſiſts on their <hi>keeping the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace,</hi> v. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And from this very Reaſon he concluded the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to be carnal, becauſe of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying, ſtrife, and diviſions that were among them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. And where-ever the Peace and Unity of the Church is broken from thoſe corrupt Principles of Pride, Self-will, and the careleſneſs of obeying God's Commandments, this ſpeaks ſuch an unchriſtian temper as will exclude ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from the Kingdom of God. And therefore thoſe very phraſes the Apoſtle makes uſe of to expreſs the Diſcords and Rents in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, are all of them enumerated in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> (tho there they be rendred by other Engliſh Words, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20.) among thoſe Works of the Fleſh, concerning which we are told with earneſtneſs of expreſſion, that <hi>they that do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="567" facs="tcp:170758:293"/>
                     <p>And I think it conſiderable to be further obſerved, that even in ſuch Perſons who are of a better Spirit, and who in the main, cloſe with the other Duties and Rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, their miſcarriage in this particular, in not holding the Peace and Unity of the Church, will leſſen and abate the degrees of that future Glorious Reward which they would otherwiſe receive: And this I think is ſufficiently declared by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> when he had rebuked the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for their Diviſions, one being of <hi>Paul,</hi> and another of <hi>Apollo,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4. he ſtill keeping his Eye upon, and having an aim at theſe Diviſions, as appears from that third, and the former part of the fourth Chapter, tells them concerning them who hold to that only foundation which the Apoſtles laid, <hi>If any ſhall build thereupon that which will not abide the Trial; if his work ſhall be burnt, he ſhall ſuffer loſs; but he himſelf ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by Fire.</hi> v. 15. That is, if any ſuch perſon ſhall be engaged in Diviſions in the Church, or in any other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable Action or Doctrine, it ſhall go the worſe with him, and be hereafter to his loſs; and though he eſcape Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and obtain Life, it ſhall be with the greater hazard, danger, and difficulty. And therefore he who would ſeek his own greateſt Good, muſt carefully avoid this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; Conſider how extreamly oppoſite, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diviſions in the Church are to Chriſt himſelf. He is one Lord and Head, he hath by one Spirit and in one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm eſtabliſhed his Church to be one Body in one and the ſame Faith and Doctrine, and upon the ſame Hope of their Calling; and under the ſame Only God and Father of all. And all theſe things S. <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth, as containing in them ſpecial Obligations for Chriſtian Unity, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5, 6. And beſides all the Precepts of his Doctrine, let us ſeriouſly obſerve how much our dying Saviour did earneſtly and again, deſire and pray that all his Diſciples might be one, <hi>John</hi> 17.11, 21, 23. And this he twice expreſſeth in his
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:170758:294"/>Prayer to be deſired to this end, <hi>that the World might believe that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> Now if it would be an unworthy thing for any perſon againſt all reaſon and duty to oppoſe the Dying Requeſt of the beſt Friend he ever had in the World; it muſt needs be unaccountable to act againſt that which was even at the point of Death, ſo affectionately and importunately deſired by our Lord and Saviour. Was this aimed at by our Lord as an uſeful means to bring over the World to believe in him? and will any who have any Honour for Chriſt or Love for Men be ſo uncharitable as to be engaged in any ſuch Works as tend to keep off Men from Chriſtianity; and from obtaining Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt. But this is ſufficiently intimated by our Saviour to be the ſad effect of the Diviſions in his Church. To all this I ſhall further add that it is related by <hi>Cruſius</hi> (<hi>Turcograec. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>part</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 234.) <hi>that it is the daily Prayer of the</hi> Turks, <hi>that Chriſtians may not be at <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> And they who are of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> expreſs their delight and ſatisfaction in our Diſagreements. <hi>Baronius</hi> (<hi>Annal. Eccleſ. An.</hi> 344. <hi>n.</hi> 9.) makes uſe of this as a conſiderable Argument againſt the truth of the Proteſtant Doctrine: and <hi>Salmeron</hi> (<hi>Tom.</hi> 9. <hi>Tr.</hi> 16. <hi>n.</hi> 1.) declares that this is that which giveth them expectations of prevailing againſt us. And now ſhall any who own themſelves the true followers of Chriſt, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to contradict the dying Requeſt of their Saviour, as in the mean time to chuſe that which complieth with, and gratifieth the Deſires both of the profeſſed Enemies of his Religion, and of thoſe alſo who ſtrangely corrupt and pervert his Doctrine and Goſpel?</p>
                     <p>But after all this, or whatſoever elſe may be ſpoken to this purpoſe, there are two ſorts of Men who I doubt are not like to be perſwaded.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I fear there are ſome fierce Men, who are ſo far from having hearts inclined to do this Duty, that they have not Patience to hear it, but rather to turn angry, and to cry out, as the Lawyer did to our Saviour, <hi>Thus ſaying, thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheſt us alſo.</hi> But it will become them, and others too,
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:170758:294"/>to bethink themſelves of the ſad danger of all thoſe perſons who will not hearken, but ſtop their Ears to ſuch plain Duties as thoſe of Peace and Unity are. But theſe Truths muſt be ſpoken, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And others there are who will acknowledg in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral the Truth of all I have ſaid of the great Sin and Evil of Schiſms and Diviſions. And though they be engaged in the dividing Parties, will plead their own Innocence, and charge the fault of theſe Diviſions wholly upon the order and conſtitution of our Church, and not upon themſelves. Now here much might be ſaid to ſhew that the Worſhip and Service of God in our Church is agreeable to the true Chriſtian Rule; and that on the other hand there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things unaccountable, yea, and unlawful, which are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced without ſcruple by Diſſenters, and contended for by the dividing Parties. But this would be too long for me to inſiſt upon in my preſent Diſcourſe. Wherefore, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, I ſhall mention a ſenſible and ocular Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that it is not the Conſtitution of our Church, but the ill temper of dividing Spirits, that is the true cauſe of our Diviſions; And that is this, That when this Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was thrown aſide between thirty and forty years ſince, the Rents and Diviſions of the Church were not by this means removed, but to the grief of good Men they were greatly encreaſed thereby; and the Spirits of many Men in this particular have been the worſe ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let all of us therefore take heed to our ſelves, that we keep in the paths of Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity; and let us mourn and pray for others who neglect them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. A ſecond thing to be done in our turning to God, is the forſaking all Viciouſneſs and Debauchery, and beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Serious and Sober. Vice defiles and debaſeth the nature of Man. It is ſo much againſt Reaſon and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and is ſo far condemned by the common ſenſe of Mankind, that it generally paſſeth for a diſparagement in
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:170758:295"/>the World. And Viciouſneſs is ſo much againſt the intereſt of Men, and the good of the World, that thereupon it is prohibited and puniſhed by the Laws even of Barbarous Nations. This is the great Folly of Evil Men, whilſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by under the appearances of trifling Pleaſures, great Cheats are impoſed upon Men, who ſhould be wiſer than to be thus decoyed into Temporal Evils and Eternal Miſeries. Now in turning to God, there muſt be a breaking off from Sin by Repentance; or a Care to depart from Evil, and to do Good. Nor is it enough that there be a mere reſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on outward Actions of Evil; but there muſt be alſo an hearty Reſolution and inward Hatred againſt Sin, and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Love of what is Good: And that this may be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, it muſt be ſet upon timely and preſently; as a Wiſe Man will uſe his utmoſt diligence to put a ſtop to a dangerous Diſeaſe before it be too late, and it become incurable. To this purpoſe let theſe three things be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Conſider how all Vice and Wickedneſs of Life is contrary to the nature of God; Such is the Purity of the Divine Being, that Sin is more oppoſite and hateful unto God, than to the moſt Vertuous Man that lives in the World. God is Light, and in him is no Darkneſs at all; and it is as poſſible for the black Darkneſs to ſtand before the brightneſs of the Sun's Light, as for the workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to be approved by the Holy God: The ſingular pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Laws, and the exceeding dreadfulneſs of his Threats againſt Wickedneſs, are intended to deter Men from the commiſſion thereof. And if we take notice of the inſtances and examples of God's diſpleaſure againſt Sin, theſe are very numerous. It was Diſobedience that turned <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe; Debauchery and Wickedneſs was that which unpeopled the old World, and cauſed them to be deſtroy'd by a Deluge; and <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> to be conſumed by Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven. By the like ſinful practices, the <hi>Jews</hi> who were God's peculiar People, and to whom he was as an Husband, were divorced from
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:170758:295"/>him; and divers Calamities have been brought down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other Perſons and Nations. And yet all theſe things come far ſhort of what will be manifeſted at the great Day, when the terrible Sentence of Eternal Perdition will be pronounced againſt all Evil-doers, who ſhall periſh with everlaſting Deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; Conſider how much wicked works are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly oppoſite to Chriſtianity. Sin is of the nature of the Devil; he is the Spirit that worketh in the Children of Diſobedience; but the Son of God was manifeſted that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. The Life of Chriſt was ſuch, that thereby he left us an example that we ſhould follow his Steps who did no Sin; and his Doctrine teacheth us, that we ſhould deny Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts. Even our Baptiſm is an undertaking to Renounce the Devil, and become dead unto Sin. And it is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable for Debauchery to be in a Chriſtian, than for the brutiſh nature to inhabit the Soul and Body of a Man; becauſe this not only oppoſeth our Profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the deſigns of our Redeemer alſo. His coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, and his Death and Paſſion was, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify to himſelf a People zealous of good Works. But that the Works of Darkneſs ſhould be embraced by the Children of Light; that they ſhould yield up themſelves to the Evil one, who have plentiful Aids and Aſſiſtances of Divine Grace to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and overcome him, is a thing altogether inexcuſable.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly; Conſider, that Viciouſneſs is the more intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when God's hand appears to be lifted up. Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Judgments are ſome of the laſt and moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means which God makes uſe of for Man's amendment. By theſe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was brought to Submiſſion, and <hi>Ahab</hi> to Humiliation: And it hath been obſerved, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> after the Seventy years Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> were never prone to follow after other Gods, as they had frequently
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:170758:296"/>done before, notwithſtanding their Inſtructions from the Prophets for towards a Thouſand years; and it is then expected that when God's Judgments are in the Earth, the Inhabitants of the World will learn Righteouſneſs; for there muſt be great obſtinacy and hardneſs, where the fears or ſtrokes of the hand of God make no Impreſſion. Now we have heard of the Calamities of Neighbour Countreys, and God hath exerciſed us with ſevere Chaſtiſements not many years ſince; his hand is now ſtretched out: if we heartily turn to him, we have reaſon to hope it will be for our help; but if not, we have cauſe to fear it will be to our hurt.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The third and laſt thing I ſhall mention to be done in hearty turning to God, is, To reject all Irreligion and neglect of the Worſhip of God, and to be exerciſed in the Religious Service of God, with true Piety and hearty Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherefore,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Let no neglect of Religion have any place amongſt us, or let all miſcarriages herein be carefully amended. The Worſhip of God, and the Inſtitutions of our Bleſſed Saviour are by too many diſregarded. But yet the Love and Fear of God, the ſerving him, and walking in all good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before him, is greatly needful to be undertaken with ſerious Diligence. This is a very great Duty of Man; for if a Child be obliged to give Honour and Reverence to his Father, or a Servant to his Maſter, or a Subject to his Prince, much more muſt Man ſtand engaged to worſhip and ſerve his Creator. The Precepts in the Holy Scripture to this purpoſe, are ſo plain and frequent, that no Man who reads the Scriptures can be ignorant of them; and they who never read them, do acknowledg this Duty by the evidence of the light of Nature it ſelf. Our owning Chriſtianity is not only a Name or Profeſſion, but is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to mind that Piety which is ſuitable to Religion. In this Profeſſion St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares his own great care to have been to worſhip the God of his Fathers after the way
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:170758:296"/>which the <hi>Jews</hi> called Hereſy, that is, according to the true Rules and Doctrine of Chriſtianity. And the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Chriſtian Church is repreſented by St. <hi>John,</hi> as ſtanding before the Throne, and crying with a loud voice, <hi>Salvation be to God and to the Lamb</hi> (Rev. 7.9, 10.) and therefore they are not worthy to be accounted any part of the Chriſtian Church, who neglect the Worſhip of the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>This alſo is our intereſt and benefit. For the moſt noble and excellent employment of Man is in thoſe things which relate to God and Goodneſs, when otherwiſe in the neglect of this, he is taken up either about empty Vanities, mean Earth, or ſordid Filth. But the Service of God is both his Honour and his Advantage, and the Promiſes which are made to Religious Piety are great and ſure; but becauſe they are propoſed under the terms of a Covenant, there can be no ſecurity of enjoying the preſent Bleſſings of God, and no poſſibility of attaining endleſs Felicity without theſe Holy Exerciſes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let the exerciſe of Religion be performed with hearty and ſerious Devotion, even with Faſting, and ſolemn Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and Prayer; theſe are Duties directed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Joel</hi> in the latter part of this Verſe of my Text, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our hearty turning unto God: And the Church doth particularly at this time call upon us to mind theſe Holy Exerciſes; they are Duties uſeful at all times, and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent qualifications to diſpoſe us aright for the obtaining the Pardon of our own Sins, as they include the practice of Humility, Piety, Faith and Repentance. Amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> the ſolemn day of Atonement and Remiſſion was a day of devout Faſting and Afflicting their Souls. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter S. <hi>Paul</hi> had been ſtricken down to the Ground as he went toward <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> after he had Faſted three days and Prayed, <hi>Ananias</hi> was then ſent to him by our Saviour, that he might ariſe and be Baptized, and waſh away his Sins, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.9, 11, 17, 18. ch. 22.16.</p>
                     <p>At this time the methods of God's Providence do emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:170758:297"/>require our more than ordinary diligence in theſe Duties for the averting his Judgments, and the preſerving us and our Poſterity from Ruine and Miſery. Let thoſe who have been Vicious and Diſobedient, engage herein with Reformation and Amendment of Life. And let the moſt Pious Men alſo undertake it with the greateſt ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even in them it is an exerciſe of Repentance, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the whole practice of Chriſtianity is; for the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Life is a turning to God, from whom ſinful Man had eſtranged himſelf; and the whole thereof is deſcribed by Repenting, and turning to God, and doing works meet for Repentance; and the Repentance undertaken therein, is not only in ſome ſhort tranſitory acts, but it taketh in the whole courſe of a Chriſtian Progreſs. Theſe devout Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the beſt Men are of great uſe for obtaining publick Bleſſings from God. And it cannot be ſuppoſed that the Religious Addreſſes of <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who were Men of great Piety, ſhould be leſs acceptable to God, or leſs effectual for the good of Man, than the Repentance of <hi>Ahab</hi> or <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> or of the <hi>Ninevites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But let theſe things be done with true uprightneſs and ſincerity of Heart, and then our Bleſſed Saviour hath aſſured them who ſo <hi>fast and pray in ſecret, that their Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will reward them openly.</hi> But withall, that theſe Duties may be pleaſing to God, it is neceſſary that they be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with thoſe other things which I have before preſſed. Faſting and Prayer, in the neglect of Peace and Unity, and of Holineſs and Piety, is as the ſacrificing an unclean thing, far from being approved of God; and this is the account the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> gives, why God would not accept theſe very performances of the <hi>Jews, Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye faſt for Strife and Debate, and to ſmite with the Fiſt of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore now let us take the advice in the Text, and reſolve on the pious practice thereof, eſpecially in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars I have inſiſted on. For the further enforcing of which, I ſhall in concluding obſerve three things.</p>
                     <pb n="575" facs="tcp:170758:297"/>
                     <p>Firſt, That it was God's own direction in theſe words of <hi>Joel.</hi> This was indeed immediately given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Whatſoever things were written afore-time, were written for our Learning, that we through Patience and Comfort of the Scripture might have hope.</hi> That which God thinks fit to adviſe us, it is our Wiſdom to practiſe. For when the Policy of Wiſe Men may be outwitted, and all ſinful contrivances will encreaſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the Counſel of God that will ſtand; and, as Wiſdom ſpeaks, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.33.) <hi>Whoſo hearkneth to me ſhall dwell ſafely, and ſhall be quiet from the fear of Evil.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly; Reflect again on the caſe in which this was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. Beſides the terribleneſs of the Armies which were to come againſt them in the former Verſes of this ſecond Chapter of <hi>Joel,</hi> God lets them know that he himſelf was like to be on their Enemies ſide againſt them, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>The Lord ſhall utter his Voice before his Army.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> was ſent to make Proclamation of God's Controverſy with them; but though this was declared by a Meſſage from God, it was not ſo abſolutely determined, but that there was ſtill an Help and Remedy reſerved, if they would make uſe thereof, by turning to God with all their heart. In like manner, when <hi>Jonas</hi> was ſent to <hi>Nineveh</hi> to declare that within forty days it ſhould be deſtroyed, upon its Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it was ſpared. And the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> aſſures us, that <hi>at what inſtant God ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, to pull down, and to deſtroy; if that Nation turn from their Evil, he will repent of the Evil that he thought to do unto them.</hi> No caſe is ſo bad, but if this courſe be made uſe of, it will appear hopeful.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly; Conſider the greatneſs of the effect. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, that in this Prophecy from this Text forward, are contained Promiſes of Deliverance. The effect was alſo anſwerable to theſe Promiſes. Indeed the preciſe time of <hi>Joel's</hi> Prophecy is not certain: It is thought both by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> writers, and by Ancient Fathers, that his time was contemporary with that of <hi>Hoſea;</hi> and this Prophecy in all
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:170758:298"/>probability muſt be dated before the latter part, if not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beginning of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Reign: and accordingly <hi>Grotius</hi> ſeems very reaſonably to underſtand the beginning of this Chapter to refer to <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army which inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Judah;</hi> this Army here mentioned was indeed called the Northern Army, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.20. but this expreſſion might well enough agree to the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army; as may appear from <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>He will ſtretch out his hand againſt the North, and destroy</hi> Aſſyria. Now at this time the Sins of <hi>Judah</hi> were great and many, eſpecially under <hi>Ahaz,</hi> their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was low and deſpiſed, and their Enemy was potent, proud and inſolent; yet upon the Pious Reformation of <hi>Judah</hi> under <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and their earneſt Religious Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to God, their Enemies proud Deſigns were wholly blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and themſelves ruined; and the bleſſing of God came down upon <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And God grant that we may take that courſe, that we may enjoy the Bleſſing of God, and have it ever continued to theſe Churches and Realms, even until the coming again of our Bleſſed Saviour: to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour, and Glory, and Praiſe, now and evermore.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <p>RELIGION and Righteouſneſs is ſo ſuitable to, and perfective of the Nature of Man, that it hath been thereupon recommended by the wiſeſt Men, and greateſt Philoſophers. It is of ſuch concernment for humane Society, that all Lawgivers and Governours have thought it neceſſary to prohibit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Violation thereof. And it carrieth ſo much of the Image of God in it, that all his Revelations to the Patriarchs and Prophets, and eſpecially that by the Holy Jeſus to the Chriſtian Church, do greatly inſiſt upon it.</p>
                     <p>When the Gentile World went greatly aſtray by their abominable Idolatries, and their groſs Impurities, even in their pretendedly Religious Rites, the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel appears to turn them from the Power of Satan unto
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:170758:299"/>God. When the Jews had been under a lower Diſpenſation, our Lord gives his Diſciples more excellent Rules, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth the Precepts of the Moral Law, as was truly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> and other ancient Writers. And why ſhould it be thought ſtrange, that Lawgiver ſhould add to the Precepts already given, and extend them further, who eſtabliſhed many new Duties, ſuch as to believe the peculiar Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith, to perform many religious Services in his Name, and with an eye to him; to attend on the Goſpel-Sacraments; to reverence the Chriſtian Miniſtry, and the Power of the Keys; and to own and embrace Communion with the diffuſive Catholick Church in all Nations? He laid new Obligations upon his Diſciples concerning Divorce, and the changing the Zeal of <hi>Elias</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſtian Meekneſs. And it is but reaſonable to expect, that under the Inſtructions and Motives of Chriſtianity, there ſhould be required greater Meaſures of the Love of God and Goodneſs. But when the Jewiſh Church had in their Principles and Practices groſly degenerated from the great Deſign of the Law, and many Corruptions were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, our Lord proteſts againſt them, and gives his Diſciples this Admonition, <hi>That their Righteouſneſs must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Phariſees were the ſtricteſt Sect of the Jews at that time, the Scribes were their chief Teachers and Guides; their Righteouſneſs here intended, was what was according to the Rules and Doctrines they delivered and received: Againſt that Leaven of Doctrine our Lord warned his Diſciples.<note place="margin">Mat. 16.12.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The out-doing and exceeding this Righteouſneſs is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that it is enjoined under this ſevere Sanction, <hi>That otherwiſe we can in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> The <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is a Phraſe peculiar to St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> among all the Penmen of the Scripture, but hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved not to be unuſual in the <hi>Talmud,</hi>

<pb n="579" facs="tcp:170758:299"/>Kingdom of Chriſt in his Church on Earth; but in this place and others, the Kingdom of Glory and eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. But if any ſhould think theſe Words directly to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that none whoſe Righteouſneſs exceeds not that of the Phariſees, and their Teachers the Scribes, can be true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Chriſtian Church, and Chriſt's Kingdom upon Earth, he muſt conſequently acknowledg that they cannot be Heirs of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Yet theſe Phariſees were not ſo wholly irreligious, but that they attended the Temple and Synagogues, made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prayers, ſeem'd to have a great Veneration for the Law, and a Zeal for the Honour of the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> They were not ſo groſly diſſolute and debauched, as to give themſelves up to Uncleanneſs, Intemperance, and all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulneſs; but they condemned Adultery, faſted, and gave Alms.

They were a particular Sect, having and needleſly affecting ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Practices and Opinions, different from the other Jews, and ſuch as were not enjoined in the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The Name <hi>Phariſee</hi> is from <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>They did not indeed withdraw themſelves from the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, or Temple Publick-Worſhip, ſince, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Antiq. Jud. l. 18. c. 2.</note>

                        </gap>, whatſoever referred to God, both Prayer, and other parts of Worſhip, were much ordered by their Model. But concerning the Synagogue-Worſhip, there is probable Evidence, that the ſeveral chief Sects among the Jews, and therefore the Phariſees as one of them, had their diſtinct Aſſemblies. And it is certain, the Phariſees did reject the beſt of Men from their Synagogue-Communion, meerly for doing their neceſſary Duty, in profeſſing, upon the fulleſt Divine Teſtimony, that Jeſus was the Chriſt, and becoming his Followers. And in the Temple-Worſhip, the Phariſees were guilty of a kind of Separation, under an appearance of Communion: For ſince the daily Sacrifice in the Temple was a Burnt-Offering, and therefore appointed for Expiation and Atonement,<note place="margin">Num. 28.3.</note> the Devotions of them who attended at the Temple at the Hours of Prayer and Sacrifice ought to be conformable thereunto; but the Phariſees Prayer there, as our Saviour deſcribes it, had nothing in it of humble Supplication for God's Mercy and Favour, but he thanks God he was not as other Men. And this Spirit of Diviſion was ſo much the worſe in them, becauſe it was founded in an high Conceit, and great Confidence of their own Righteouſneſs, though they had little reaſon for it, and in a contempt of others.</p>
                     <p>But now ſuch a proud Temper is inconſiſtent with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, which makes Humility a neceſſary Qualification for the obtaining everlaſting Life.</p>
                     <p>And Diviſions and Separations are ſo unaccountable for the Members of the ſame Body the Church to be engaged in, that the Doctrine of Chriſt gives us frequent Precepts, earneſt Exhortations, and preſſing Arguments to Peace and Unity, and plainly expreſſeth the great Danger of Miſery in the neglect thereof.

                     <p n="6">6. And laſtly; They left themſelves and their Followers at a licentious Liberty in many weighty Matters of Doctrine
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:170758:302"/>and Practice. They could ſuffer their Hands to be Polluted by devouring Widows Houſes, and their Tables by Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Exceſs. They made void the Commands of God by their Traditions, and were ſuch Caſuiſts, as to allow Swearing by Heaven and Earth, and to account ſuch Oaths, as thoſe by the Temple and the Altar, to leave no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when Swearing by the Gold of the Temple, or the Gift upon the Altar, did oblige. And it is manifeſt from this fifth chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that according to their ſtricteſt Rules, they gave allowance to inward Wrath, and Hatred, and Luſt, if it did not break forth in open Murther, or Adultery, as was noted by <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tert. de Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. c. 2.</note> who alſo obſerveth how ſtrictly extenſive our Saviour's Doctrine is, even againſt the unchaſt Eye and inward Wrath, or in the phraſe of St. <hi>John, That he that hateth his Brother is a Murtherer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the excellent Chriſtian Rules of Life, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the inward Man, and far out-do the looſe Principles of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> are many of them propoſed by the Bleſſed Jeſus in this and the following Chapters, and are included under that Sanction at the cloſe of this Sermon on the Mount, <hi>that he that hears theſe words of his, and doth them not, is likened to him who builds his Houſe on the Sand, which ends in a dreadful fall.</hi> And Vertuous Practices are ſo far from pleading any allowance from Chriſtianity, that, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever breaks the leaſt Commandment, and teacheth Men ſo, ſhall be called leaſt,</hi> or not be accounted of, <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe things I have diſcourſed of, are ſufficient to ſhew the groſs miſcarriages of the <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Righteouſneſs, in oppoſing the neceſſary Duties of Unity, Meekneſs, Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, true Religious Piety, Obedience, and Univerſal Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and therefore this could be no ſafe way to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>I now come to the ſecond Enquiry; How ſtands the caſe of thoſe Societies, who lay the chief claims to Chriſtianity, as to their exceeding, or not exceeding the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> in theſe particulars?</p>
                     <pb n="586" facs="tcp:170758:303"/>
                     <p>And here I ſhall not ranſack the remote and diſtant parts of the World, but take notice only of thoſe with which we are concerned; as, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and the Diſſenting Parties among us. Nor ſhall I ſtrain reſemblances to make the Caſes appear Parallel, but ſhall take notice of things as they really are, to obſerve how far there is a likeneſs to, or compliance with the Spirit of <hi>Phariſaiſm.</hi> And here I profeſs, that I ſeriouſly wiſh well to all Men of what Party ſoever; and therefore whatever I ſhall ſay that ſpeaks the error or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of any of them, is not out of deſign to caſt reproach upon them, but out of this true Charitable End, to warn others to take heed thereof; and I ſhould be glad if it might make any of them conſider of the error of their way.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Concerning Separation and Diviſion. This was eſteemed by the ancient Church as an heinous Crime. St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> equals it with Hereſy,<note place="margin">Chr. in Eph. Cyp. de Unit. Eccl.</note> and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> makes it a greater offence than that of the <hi>Lapſi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> is clear herein; it owns and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth the Catholick and Apoſtolick Faith and Doctrine, and none other, and appoints a way of Worſhip agreeable thereto, and ſo gives no cauſe to warrant any Separation from her. Our Caſe with reſpect to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, is in part like that of the Apoſtles, with regard to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> whileſt they profeſſed the true Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and worſhipped God after the way which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly called Hereſy;<note place="margin">Joh. 12.42.</note> the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſentenced ſuch to be put out of the Synagogue: And the <hi>Talmud</hi> of the <hi>Venice</hi> Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been obſerved to affirm, That <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf was Excommunicated with the <hi>Shammatha,</hi> or great Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication: And becauſe we (as we ought) reject the evil and corrupt <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrines and Practices, they cenſure us as Hereticks, and let fly their <hi>Anathema</hi>'s in various Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of <hi>Trent,</hi> and yearly denounce their Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Bull in <hi>Coena Domini.</hi> And beſides this, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not join in the main part of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Worſhip, without
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:170758:303"/>embracing their Superſtitious and Idolatrous Practices: Nor have they any Right of Juriſdiction over us. And all this acquits us from the Crime of Schiſm in our Reformation.</p>
                     <p>But they at <hi>Rome,</hi> though they keep to their publick Worſhip as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did, are yet groſsly guilty of Schiſm, by unjuſtly rejecting all other Chriſtian Churches, who make uſe of their own juſt Rights; and are not more ready to ſubmit to St. <hi>Peters</hi> pretended Succeſſor, and his Impoſtures, than to the Precepts and Doctrines of his and our Lord and Maſter. And herein they paſs Sentence, as the <hi>Phariſee</hi> did againſt the <hi>Publican,</hi> upon them who are better than themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Other Parties at home, practiſe Diviſions in an higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree than the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did, openly ſeparating themſelves from the publick Aſſemblies of our Chriſtian Worſhip.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Concerning fierceneſs and furiouſneſs of Zeal. Our Church entertains no Bloody nor Uncharitable Doctrines or Tenents; its Rules concerning Government, contain as much mildneſs as can conſiſt with Peace and Order; and its Practice rather more, by reaſon of the diſtemper and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of the minds of Men.</p>
                     <p>But ſuch is the <hi>Romiſh</hi> fierceneſs, that in the higheſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Charity, they exclude other Churches from Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And their furious Zeal appears by Fire and Faggot, by bloody Inquiſitions, Maſſacres, and Rebellions; by Horrid Treaſons and cruel Conſpiracies; of which the World hath had, and we have abundant Evidence. Theſe things are ſo unlike Chriſtianity, and Jeſus the Saviour, that they betray themſelves to be from the <hi>Abaddon</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <pb n="588" facs="tcp:170758:304"/>
                     <p>And in other Diſſenting Parties, it is too manifeſt how prone their forward and leading Men are to cenſorious Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs, and raſh Judging; and how ready they have been, unjuſtly to take up the Sword, and purſue the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of their Party with War and Blood; with ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as I forbear to mention.</p>
                     <p>And the conſideration of this temper may give us ſome account of the great eagerneſs, and reſtleſs earneſtneſs of theſe erring Parties, in propagating their particular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Concerning the aiming to gain the applauſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Men in the neglect of Duty. Our Church, in its Rules of Doctrine, lays the ſame ſtreſs upon all Duties to God or Man, that the Goſpel of our Saviour doth; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out yielding to the Humours of the Profane, the Debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the Turbulent and Unruly.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſuit themſelves to all Diſpoſitions; they have ſevere Rules in ſome of their Regular Societies, for the more Serious; but they take great care to gratify Wicked and Debauched Perſons alſo, with as much Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as they can well deſire. Their Caſuiſts generally declare, That an act of Attrition, or ſuch Sorrow for Sin as is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with hatred againſt it, or the true Love of God, is at laſt ſufficient, with Abſolution, to remove the guilt of Sin, and ſecure them from Eternal Death. But if tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Puniſhment remains for them, this can only bring them to Purgatory; and here they may have conſiderable help from Indulgences, and the Treaſury of the Church, which are diſpenſed for <hi>Ave-Maries</hi> and other Prayers, viſiting certain places, having Maſſes ſaid for their Souls, and by other works, without their becoming really holy and good. And beſides this, their feigned Miracles and Revelations, their pretended power of Tranſubſtantiating, of diſpenſing the Treaſury of Merits in the Church, and of juſtifying them who are not contrite, by Abſolution, ſeem methods contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to gain admiration from the People.</p>
                     <pb n="589" facs="tcp:170758:304"/>
                     <p>And other Sects make their Intereſts, and ſeek Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by popular Arts; and often by promoting or conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at Uncharitableneſs, Mens high Conceits of themſelves, and a Temper averſe from Unity and Obedience; which are things of a very evil Nature: And ſome of their chief Teachers acknowledg, that in ſome things they act againſt their own Judgments in compliance with their People.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Concerning Superſtitious urging thoſe things as parts of Religion which are not ſuch. Our Church owneth no neceſſary Article of Faith, but what is in our Creed, nor any Doctrines of Chriſtianity, but what are deducible from the Holy Scriptures. Our Conſtitutions for Decency, and Rules of Order are eſtabliſhed only as ſuch; and are withal innocent, uſeful, few, and agreeing to Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
                     <p>But at <hi>Rome,</hi> a great part of their Religion, as they make it, conſiſts in acknowledging many things to be <hi>de Fide;</hi> which are neither contained in the Scriptures, agreeing with them, nor acknowledged in the ancient Church; in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining various falſe Doctrines and pretended Traditions with equal reverence to the Holy Scriptures; and in uſing divers Rites as operative of Divine Aid and Grace, which God never appointed to that end.</p>
                     <p>Our other dividing Parties are too nigh the <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Doctrine concerning the Obligation of their voluntary Vow againſt their Duty to Superiours. And many of them lay a Doctrinal Neceſſity, either upon diſowning Epiſcopal Authority, which hath ſo great a Teſtimony of Apoſtolical Appointment: Or, in being againſt Forms of Prayer, at leaſt ſuch, wherein the People vocally join; or, in condemning as ſinful, innocent Appointments, decent Ceremonies, and ſuitable Geſtures. And thoſe who own not theſe Poſitions, nor condemn our Worſhip as ſinful, and yet divide from us; muſt aſſert other Poſitions for Doctrines, which are equally erroneous and dangerous: For, if their Principles be agreeable to their Practice, they muſt aſſert, that Men may break the Churches Peace, and expoſe it to the greateſt
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:170758:305"/>hazards, gratify its Enemies, and diſobey Authority, which are great Sins, to maintain an oppoſition to thoſe things which themſelves dare not charge with any Sin. But this is to aver ſuch Doctrine to be from God, which is contrary to his Religion, his Nature and his Will, and are but the Precepts of Men; and it is to ſtrain at a Gnat, but ſwallow a Camel.</p>
                     <p>Now, if to counterfeit the Seal, or Coin, or falſely to pretend to the Authority of an Earthly Prince, be greatly culpable; can it be otherwiſe to ſtamp a Divine Impreſſion on things which God diſowns.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Concerning Obedience and Submiſſion to Superiors; this Duty is regularly enjoined in our Church, both with reſpect to Private Relations, Spiritual Guides, and Civil Rulers.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church there is ſtrict Obedience required in their ſeveral Orders, to the Superiors thereof; in the Laiety to the Clergy; and in all, to the Pope: But this is ſo irregular, that thereby the natural Honour to Parents is much diſcharged; and St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Precept of <hi>Honouring the King,</hi> is, under the name of his Vicar, changed into ſuch Poſitions, as when occaſion ſerves, may encourage the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and Murdering him.</p>
                     <p>And among other Diſſenters, their Diviſions, as they are circumſtantiated, are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ſuch viſible Teſtimonies of their want of Submiſſion to their Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Governours, that nothing need be added. And it is known there were ſome of theſe Parties, whoſe Principles allowed them to take Arms againſt their King; and who expoſed his Royal Perſon to Violence and Death.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Concerning a looſe and licentious Life. Our Church requires a Sincere, Holy Exerciſe, and preſſeth all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of our Saviour, and the Motives and Arguments of the Goſpel; and enjoineth the careful obſervation of our Baptiſmal Vow.</p>
                     <p>But in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, he that conſiders the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral looſeneſs of the Jeſuits and other Caſuiſts, may wonder
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:170758:305"/>that ſuch things ſhould be owned by Men of any Religion, much more of them who profeſs the Chriſtian Religion. For inſtance; By our Saviour's Doctrine, <hi>to love God with all the heart,</hi> is the great and firſt Commandment. But <hi>Azorius</hi> aſſerts,<note place="margin">Azor. Tom. 1. l. 9. c. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>That it is hard to fix any time, when this Precept of Loving God doth oblige to any exerciſe thereof, with reſpect to it ſelf, but only when it is neceſſary to Repentance.</hi> And he roundly ſaith, <hi>We are not obliged to any exerciſe of Love to God, when we attain to the uſe of Reaſon, nor at the receiving any Sacrament, not at Confeſſion, nor at the approach of Death.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Filiuc. Tr. 22. c. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Filiucius</hi> thinks this Opinion probable (and therefore ſafe by their Doctrine of Probability) but prefers another Opinion, which is but little better; <hi>That we are bound to act Love to God at the time of Death, and in ſome other extraordinary caſes if they happen; and that ordinarily Men ought to exerciſe an act of Love to God, at leaſt once in five years.</hi> But I am amazed to think how ſparing ſuch Men were of inward Religious Devotion, and what Strangers to it!</p>
                     <p>And for the practice of Repentance, which is another great Duty of our Religion. Though Contrition, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes an hating and forſaking Sin, and turning to God, be acknowledged of good uſe by them; yet <hi>Filiucius</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Fil. Tr. 6 c 8. n. 196, 197, and 208.</note> 
                        <hi>Men are not obliged to acts of Contrition every year, but once in five or ſeven years; and that if they die without them, they may be ſaved.</hi> But <hi>Layman</hi> declares,<note place="margin">Laym. l. 5. Tr. 6. c. 2. n. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>That the Precept and Duty of Repentance is ſatisfied by coming once in a year with Attrition to Confeſſion, and the Sacrament of Penance, and by doing the ſame at the time of Death.</hi> But is not this a Religion ſet up to undermine the Holy Goſpel of our Saviour, and to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thoſe workers of Iniquity to Heaven, whom his Doctrine will condemn to Hell?</p>
                     <p>And our other Parties give too much allowance to ſome particular miſcarriages which I have before mentioned. And many of them lay not that ſtreſs they ought, on a Holy Life in general (which is included under Converſion and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) in that they do not account it a neceſſary condition or previous qualification for the obtaining the Favour of
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:170758:306"/>God, and the Pardon of Sin, or, which is all one, for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</p>
                     <p>Having now gone through theſe Heads of Diſcourſe, I ſhall further here obſerve three things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are not only thus far guilty of equal, but are chargeable with much greater miſcarriages than thoſe of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi> I might have run on the Parallel farther: as when the one devoured Widows Houſes, under a pretence of long Prayers; the other carry on the like deſigns of Covetouſneſs and Extortion, by their Indulgences and Maſſes for the Dead.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were not ſo degenerate, as to offer their Prayers or Sacrifices to Saints, or even to Angels (though the Law was given by their Miniſtration,) but to ſuch the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church directs a great part of her Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. They gave not Divine Honour, either to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which was the place of God's Preſence, or to any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as the Papiſts do to the Hoſt. They worſhipped not the Inviſible God under the debaſing repreſentation of an Image, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> did, and the <hi>Romanists</hi> do. And when God appointed a continual Burnt-Offering, with a Meat-Offering and Drink-Offering, they did not make ſo bold as to alter his Inſtitutions, and withdraw one part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as they at <hi>Rome</hi> have done concerning the diſtribution of the <hi>Euchariſtical</hi> Cup. And when the <hi>Phariſees</hi> had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo much Pride, as vainly to account themſelves righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and far better than others; they did not, as the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> do, pretend to ſuch Supererogation, and ſo great a ſtock of Merits, as to be able thereby to ſupply the defects of others. But if they at <hi>Rome</hi> had what they pretend, it had need be a vaſt Treaſury of good Works, to make amends for the notorious bad ones, which are the reſult of the Poſitions allowed and maintained in that Church. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> claimed a great Authority to be Maſters of the Faith of others; but it doth not appear that they found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:170758:306"/>this in ſo high and unreaſonable a claim to Infallibility, as they at <hi>Rome</hi> do; the holding of which engageth them to continue in all their other Errors. Nor were they ſo deeply uncharitable, as utterly to exclude the <hi>Eſſens,</hi> and all other Sects from the favour of God, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> deal with all other Churches; nor did they debar the people from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; I obſerve that other Dividing Parties, though they are very different among themſelves, and are not all to be alike eſteemed of; yet either all, or moſt of them, have ſome miſcarriages not received by the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees:</hi> for inſtance, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did not ſlight or neglect the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Old Teſtament, either Circumciſion, or the Paſsover; as too many now do, one or both the Sacraments of the New. They never gave way that the Temple-Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and other ſuch like Services of God, ſhould be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any other, but only thoſe Prieſts whom God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that purpoſe; when many in our days can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and allow the performance of Chriſtian Miniſtrations by thoſe who have no Regular, Authoritative and Juſtifiable Ordination: And ſuch things, however ſome eſteem of them, are of the greater moment, becauſe they violate the peculiar Inſtitutions of our Lord, and the ordinary way that he hath appointed for the conveying and applying the Grace of the Goſpel, and the benefits of his Death and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly; I obſerve alſo, that it muſt be acknowledged there were other great Crimes of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which are not chargeable on any of thoſe Parties, of whom I have diſcourſed: Such were their profeſſed diſowning our Saviour and his Doctrine, their actual contriving his Death, and their obſtinacy under thoſe various mighty Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which were frequently wrought before their Eyes. But as the former Tranſgreſſions which I mentioned, have been particularly proved deſtructive, ſo I think them to
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:170758:307"/>be eſpecially intended in this ſevere cenſure of our Saviour, of the inſufficiency of their Righteouſneſs. For theſe words were uttered ſoon after he began to teach; and before the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> had declared their greateſt enmity to his Perſon, their obſtinacy under his Miracles, or their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivement of his Death; and therefore they muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their Righteouſneſs, according to that time when theſe words were ſpoken. And the ſcope of his Diſcourſe ſhews him to condemn, as greatly defective, ſuch Rules of Doctrine and Practice, as they then directed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
                     <p>I now come in the third place, as my Concluſion, to note the reſult of theſe Enquiries in two particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt; This ſhould warn thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> and other oppoſite Perſwaſions, to conſider ſeriouſly of their own Danger, and of what may conduce to their Safety. If they think themſelves ſufficiently ſecure, ſo did alſo the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> of whom our Saviour judged otherwiſe. And I could heartily wiſh, that all perſons of their ſeveral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions were really free from all things ſinful and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                     <p>I think my ſelf obliged to expreſs as much Charity to others, as can be conſiſtent with Truth and a ſober Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore I freely acknowledge that the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parties who divide from our Church, are not all equally chargeable with many things I have inſiſted on; and I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily hope, that in all theſe various diviſions there may be ſeveral particular perſons led aſide by meer miſtake and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion, and whoſe uprightneſs of intention may be a preſervative to them from much of that evil they might otherwiſe be engaged in. And though all Sin is every where prejudicial, I hope alſo that thoſe miſcarriages which ſuch perſons are brought into, by their undiſcerned Errors, will not exclude them from the Mercy of God; and many of their Practices may be better than their Principles.</p>

                     <p>But whilſt any of us may expreſs our Charity towards them, and hope the beſt, it becomes them to have that care of themſelves, as to fear the worſt: For Charity doth not make the Condition of other Men ſafe unto whom it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but this muſt be determined by the Judgment of God. Thoſe Perſons, whoſe Minds or Practices are really worſe than other Men hope them to be, are in never the better State for ſuch charitable Hopes. And whoſoever are engaged in any of thoſe Evils which were included in Phariſaiſm, and condemned in Chriſtianity, had need care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to reflect on themſelves, and heartily and timely to amend.</p>
                     <p>But if any ſhould be offended at a Diſcourſe that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to them the Danger of their Practices, and ſhould be more ready to cenſure it as uncharitable, than to weigh and conſider it; they may know, that as this ſpeaks a very bad Temper of Mind prevailing in them, ſo the letting Men alone in their ſinful Actions, is ſo far from being any part of that Charity which our Saviour practiſed or enjoined, that it is more agreeable with the Temper of the Evil One, who is willing that they who do amiſs ſhould continue in their Evil, be flattered therein, and not ſo conſider thereof as to forſake it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; Let all who are of our Church, and whoever embrace the true Catholick Communion, be careful and ſerious in practiſing Holineſs and Righteouſneſs. Our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Profeſſion condemneth and diſowneth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Principles and corrupt Practices. And as the more devout Jews daily bleſſed God, that they were born <hi>Jews,</hi> and not of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> the Gentiles; ſo have we great reaſon to praiſe God, that we live in this excellent Church, and are thereby free from various Snares, to which many others are expoſed.</p>
                     <p>But if amongſt us, Debauchery, Profaneneſs, or Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, prevail upon any Perſons whomſoever, ſuch Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life will exclude Perſons of the pureſt Profeſſion and Belief from ever entring into Heaven. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
                        <pb n="596" facs="tcp:170758:308"/>ſometimes warns againſt this,<note place="margin">Aug. de Civ. Dei, l. 20. c. 9. &amp; de fid. &amp; oper.</note> as a conſiderable Defect in the Phariſees Righteouſneſs, that while they ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Chair, our Lord tells us, <hi>they ſay, but do not.</hi> If ever we will be happy, our Practice muſt anſwer our Profeſſion; the Doctrine of Chriſtianity is a Doctrine according to Godlineſs, and muſt be improved to that End. An Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical or Schiſmatical Life, as ſome ancient Writers call that vicious Converſation which ſeparates the Man from the Ways of God and Religion, is the more unaccountable and inexcuſable, when it contradicteth and croſſeth the moſt Catholick Profeſſion, and the beſt Rules of Duty clearly propoſed. Wherefore let us be careful, that as the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs required in the Doctrine of our Church, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Goſpel of our Saviour, doth greatly exceed that of the Scribes and Phariſees; ſo may that of our Lives alſo, in conformity to that Doctrine: Which God of his Mercy grant, through the Merits of our holy and bleſſed Saviour, <hi>To whom, &amp;c.</hi>
